 My life is a movie
and everyone's watching.
So let's get to the good part
and pass all the nonsenseSometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
but they don't even know that I'm hurtingThis life's not easy
I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human
Don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me
But you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show youI'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show youI gotta learn things
Learn them the hard way
Gotta see what it feels like
No matter what they saySometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
but they don't even know that I'm hurtingThis life's not easy
I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human
Don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me
But you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show youI'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show youThis life's not easy
I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human
Don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me
But you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show youI'll show you
