 That's this..
Can't sit in my room alone
I can't eat, I can't sleep
No...
And I wanna pick up my phone
But I can't speak, I can't breathe
Cause you're not here with me
You're my everything
And I can't stand to see another man making you smile, your smile, your
Cause you're not here with me
You're my everything
And I can't stand and see another man making you smile, your smile, your
How can I let you go
You were mine
Seems that we were doing just fine
But I was blind and now I know
That I'm all alone, all alone
I was dumb, I was wrong
Now I'm wishing you come back home but your not
Now I'm still home...
She was the one I let get away (get away) one I let get away(get away) one I let get away (get away from me)
She was the one I let get away
( get away) one I let get away (get away) one I let get away (get away from me from me)
Baby I want you to know
That we were supposed to go
So far away, so far away
Then I let you go, and even now I regret that I did you wrong, and baby I know that you tried your hardest to keep us together but now i'm down
Cause you're not here with me
You're my everything
And I can't stand and see another man making you smile, your smile, your
Cause you're not here with me
You're my everything
And I can't stand and see another man making you smile, your smile, your
How can I let you go
You were mine
Seems that we were doing just fine
But I was blind and now I know
That I'm all alone, all alone
I was dumb, I was wrong
Now I'm wishing you come back home but your not
Now I'm stuck...
She was the one I let get away
(get away) one I let get away (get away) one I let get away (get away from me)
She was the one I let get away
(get away) one I let get away (get away) one I let get away (get away from me)
