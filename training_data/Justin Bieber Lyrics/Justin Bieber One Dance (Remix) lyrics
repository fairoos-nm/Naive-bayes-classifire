 Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothing like you and me
I don't know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
A little life with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
You know, I like that you're wild
So make your way over here right now
We only got a little while
Just thinkin' out loud
Celebrate life with me babe
Don't be in a rush to go now
Oh girl
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me
Hold on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
One more dance is all I need
One more dance is all I need
Oh, oh, oh
