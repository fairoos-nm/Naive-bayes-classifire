 maybe it could have some lyrics like these:
since the first day i met her i knew she was the one
or
i know shes the one I've been searching for all my life
or
there's not a day that i could go without her , i have to see her beautiful face
or
every time im with her i fell like if im dreaming
or
i just cant stop thinking about her
or
i love everything about her, there's not one thing that I'll ever change about her
or
there's something about her that makes me fall in love with her within everyday
or
its like a dream come true, i still cant believe how a pretty lady like her fell in love with me
or
shes the best girlfriend I've had so far
well thats all i got for now!!
