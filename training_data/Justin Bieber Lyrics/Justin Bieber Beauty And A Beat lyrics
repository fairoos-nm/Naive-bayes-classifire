What you got, a billion could've never bought (eh, eh, eh)

I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for yaCause all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all 'bout you, when the music makes you move
