 Everybody gets high sometimes, you know
What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your ownAnd if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you knowI won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonightCause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow
And I wanna lay with you 'til I'm old
You shouldn't be fighting on your ownAnd if you feel you're sinking, I will jump right over
Into cold, cold water for you
And although time may take us into different places
I will still be patient with you
And I hope you knowI won't let go
(I won't let go, no no, no no no no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonightCome on, come on
Save me from my rocking boat
I just wanna stay afloat
I'm all alone
And I hope, I hope someone come and take me home
Somewhere I can rest my soul
I need to know you won't let goI won't let go
(I won't let go, no no, no no no no)
I'll be your lifeline tonight
I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonightI won't let go
I won't let go
