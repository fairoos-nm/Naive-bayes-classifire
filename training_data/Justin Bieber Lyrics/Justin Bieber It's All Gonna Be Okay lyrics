 [Intro: Justin Bieber]
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Well, tell me is it wrong?
Wrong for me to say this?
That our relationships been rough for a long time
Well baby, do you care?
Care about my heart, babe?
Acting like it's always you
Baby girl, I want to make you
I wanna make you mine[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel the love in the air
Oh! You know I got you baby
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't wanna do this
No, I don't wanna do this
You come in here sayin' that you only wanna be friends
I don't wanna do this
No, I don't wanna do this
When you're down for the week
But then you're gone for the weekend[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel love in the air
Oh! You know I got you baby
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go[Verse 3: Jaden Smith]
So when the lights turn off
And this love don't last
There is one question I would ask
Is it cause when we first started, we was movin' really fast
It is cause it was blurry and we worried by the past
Well now baby girl, I'm starting fresh
Every time I see you like we never met
Better yet, Imma get a jet, we fly to Paris, on the wheel like it was Ferris
Baby girl you who I cherish
Don't get worried about your parents
We gon' chill
And girl I'll be your biggest crush
When I walk up in the room
Girl, You know I see you blush, hush!
Girl, I know you feel this lust
Girl, you always on my side, cause you know that, that's a must, yes us[Post-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go
Tell me, Do you love me?
Do you need me? Do you want me back?
'Cause I got you
And I'll never let you go-go-go[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
It's all gonna be okay
I'll be waiting for you
Baby, if you take my hand
Baby, if you take my hand
We can never go nowhere
Can't you feel love in the air
Oh! You know I got you baby
