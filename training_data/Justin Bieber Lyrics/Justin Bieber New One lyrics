 [Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah[Chorus]
I pull up in my new whip, baby, that's my new one
You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one
(I, I just need a new one, I, I just need that brand new one, yeah)[Verse]
They just wanna play with me, they just wanna play with me
Just got back from the Middle East
Maybe just a little cheese, still wanna play with me?
Back to the crib for two minutes, I got something to do
Yeah, you get it
Yeah I copped something new, a new get-up
Yeah, phone coming through, you keep your head up
Gotta have all the new kicks, better have all the new tricks
And my bank go shit, gotta have all the new whips
Gotta have all the new chicks, my bad, I'm sick
I never had a problem with a money clip
Paper always glazed like a honey dip
I was always raised like "Honey, quit"
I'm just being funny with this funny shit[Chorus]
I pull up in my new whip, baby, that's my new one
You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah, oh yeah[Chorus]
I pull up in my new whip, baby, that's my new one
You ask me who my crew is, baby there's no new ones
And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new one
(I, I just need a new one, I, I just need that brand new one, yeah)
