 Ohh wooaah You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apartAre we an item? Girl quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like...Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mineFor you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me til' you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be aroundAnd I'm like
Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm 16 and I thought that you'd be mine
But but but now you're gone
So far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love and its right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong
We were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favorite song
She was wrong
I am gone
I thought I loved her
Never but no one above her
Yes she was my lover
But now until another like...Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)Baby, baby, baby oooh
I'm like baby, baby, baby nooo
I'm like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah, Yeah Yeah Yeah,,
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone
I'm gone
