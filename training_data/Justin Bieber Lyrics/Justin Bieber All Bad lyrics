 It's another, if it ain't one thing
Instigators, like putting fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females
And how they like to run they mouths
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
(like you) you (like you)
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your moodThey try to get at me
(they try to get at me)
Behind your back
(your back, your back, your back)
They try to tell me that I'm just like the others
That I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad
All bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my badNo I ain't all badBetween us, they wanna come in
Worst enemy, so they try to be your best friend
Perfect
Ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn
Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be to you
to you
Envy, envy
Same thing as jealousyJealous of you
That's what they doThey try to get at me
(they try to get at me)
Behind your back
(your back, your back, your back)
They try to tell me that I'm just like the others
That I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad
All bad, all bad
I ain't that bad
All bad all bad
I might make you mad
So mad, my bad
No I ain't all bad
