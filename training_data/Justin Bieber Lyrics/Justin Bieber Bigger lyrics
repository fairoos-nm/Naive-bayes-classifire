 Her love, her love is, biggerHer love, her love is, bigger
Her love, her love is, bigger
Big
Gotta believe in me
Believe me like a fairytale
Put your tooth under your pillowcase
No I won't, I won'tHave I ever let you down? (No)
Like a see-saw it's down (Oh)
You know why
'Cause we ain't in the playground
No more games
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to ride
I was a player, when I was littleBut I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker, when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear they look so small from up here'Cause were bigger, a lot bigger
I'm bigger, and you're bigger
(Whooaaa)
I remember when my heart was young
Was still bigger than me (still bigger than me)
Is that the reason that you stayed?
Most would have got rid of me (hey)
Now the bullies in the school yard
Can't take a hugs and our kisses from us (No)
Because, we ain't pushovers no more, baby
We're big enough, to stand in the picture
We're big enough, to stand next to ride
I was a player, when I was littleBut I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker, when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear they look so small from up here
'Cause were bigger, a lot bigger
I'm bigger, and you're bigger
I was a player, when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm biggerA heartbreaker, when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear they look so small from up here
'Cause were bigger, a lot biggerI'm bigger, and you're bigger
(Oohh)
I remember that, like yesterday
We were little then, my baby.
Ooh, you oh, whaoo
Since then all I can remember, is the love falling down
I was a player, when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker, when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear they look so small from up here
'Cause were bigger, a lot bigger
I'm bigger, and you're biggerI was a player, when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
A heartbreaker, when I was little
But I'm bigger, I'm bigger
And all the haters, I swear they look so small from up here
a lot bigger
im bigger

Whooaaa
