 Oh no, oh no, oh
They say that hate has been sentSo let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby, give me one last hug
There's a dream that I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
And when you hold my hand then I understand
That it's meant to be 'cause, baby, when you're with me
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl'Cause when I stare in your eyes it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, soLet the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all
'Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go
I got my favorite girl
Not feeling no pain, no fear
Don't have a care in the world
Why would I when you are here?There's a moment I've been chasing
And I finally caught it out on this floor
Baby, there's no hesitation, no reservation
By taking a chance and more, oh no, because
It's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
'Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, soLet the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all'Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you goIt's like an angel came by and took me to heaven
Like you took me to heaven, girl
'Cause when I stare in your eyes, it couldn't be better
I don't want you to go, oh no, so
Take my hand, let's just dance
Watch my feet, follow me
Don't be scared, girl, I'm here
If you didn't know, this is loveLet the music blast, we gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on, they don't matter at all, oh baby
'Cause this life's too long and this love's too strong
So baby, know for sure that I'll never let you go
So don't fear, don't you worry 'bout a thing
