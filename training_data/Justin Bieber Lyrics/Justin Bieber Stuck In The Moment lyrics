 With you, with you
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place.
Now Romeo and JulietBet they never felt the way we felt.
Bonnie and Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do.You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be youNow you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall butWe're tripping in our hearts and
It's reckless and clumsyCause I know you can't love me, hey
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the momentAnd there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam and Eve
Tragedy was our destinyLike Sonny and Cher
I don't care, I've got you baby.
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right butWe are both too foolish to stop.
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts andIt's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me, hey
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another placeBut everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and spaceCause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like just because this cold, cruel world
Saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagreeAnd I ain't with it.
And I don't wanna be so old and grayReminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment
(Yeah oh no no no)
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
To fight with time and space (and space).
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
