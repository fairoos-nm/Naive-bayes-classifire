Oh
So back and forth that's how its seems
Whoa
And when I want to talk
You say to me
That if its meant to be
It will be
Ohhohhhoh
So crazy is this thing
We call love
And now that we've got it we just can't give up
I'm reaching out for you
Got me out here in the water and I
I'm overboard
And I need your love
Pull me up
I cant swim on my own
It's too much
Feels like I'm drowning without
Your love
So throw yourself out to me
