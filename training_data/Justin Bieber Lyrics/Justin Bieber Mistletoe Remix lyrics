 It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoeI don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoeWith you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoeEveryone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoeWord on the street Santa's coming tonight,
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoeWith you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoeWith you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoeAye, love, the wise men followed the star
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracleAye, love, don't you buy me nothing
'cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry ChristmasIt's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoeI don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoeWith you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you under the mistletoeWith you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe, under the mistletoeKiss me underneath the mistletoe
Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh
Oh, oh, ohhhKiss me underneath the mistletoe,
Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh
Oh, oh, ohhh
