 This is the time of year we can give it, give it, give it, give it all
One through ten on your list you can get it, get it, get it, get it all
Make your wish tonight, when you open your eyes
When the lights go bright girl, I'll be right thereBaby you deserve everything you want, it's your night, oh
Wanna put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like fa la la, fa la laBaby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like fa la la, fa la la
Know that it's Christmas timeYou got on my favorite dress
You're looking, looking, looking, good
Snow falling on your hair, and I don't, I don't wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
I wanna be your biggest giftBaby you deserve everything you want
It's your night, oh
I wanna put my ear to your chest, nowBaby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like fa la la, fa la laBaby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like fa la la, fa la la
Know that it's Christmas timeI'll deck your heart with boughs of holly
Fa la la, fa la la
Baby 'cause you're the reason to be jolly
Fa la la, fa la la (baby girl) la la laI hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like fa la la, fa la laBaby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like fa la la, fa la la
Know that it's Christmas timeFa la la, fa la la
Like Christmas, oh oh oh
Know that it's Christmas timeFa la la, fa la la
La la la la la
Know that it's Christmas time
Yeah yeah
