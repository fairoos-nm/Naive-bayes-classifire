 [Intro]
BloodPopÂ®[Verse 1]
I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest (ooh-ooh)[Pre-Chorus]
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good[Chorus]
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?[Verse 2]
Wonderin' if you got a body
To hold you tighter since I left (since I left)
Wonderin' if you think about me (uh-huh)
Actually, don't answer that (uh-huh)[Pre-Chorus]
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good[Chorus]
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
And if it ends, can we be friends?[Pre-Chorus]
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good[Chorus]
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends, can we be friends?
