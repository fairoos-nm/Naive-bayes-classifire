 I said girl, what you wanna do with me?
I could be your fantasy tonight
I said girl, what you, what you wanna do?
Yeah, cause it's just me and you tonight, tonightWell people say it can't be real
But love is in the air right now
And you can tell I really care right now
When I touch you like that, babeStay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
We'll be fine, girl you know that we'll be fine
You could never leave my mind
Girl you know that we'll be fineI said girl, we can take it to the floor
Oh, I'll have you screaming more tonight
I said girl, we could lay her watch a movie
We could jump in a jacuzzi tonightWell people say it can't be real
But love is in the air right now
And you can tell I really care right now
When I touch you like that, babeStay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fineWell I ain't looking for a heartbreak
Now it's a feeling that I can't shake
No time for the heartache
Too busy making out what it meant to me
Du-oh-oh-oh
No time for the mistakes
Du-oh-oh-oh
I just wanna say that...Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
We'll be fine, girl you know that we'll be fine
You could never leave my mind
Girl you know that we'll be fine
