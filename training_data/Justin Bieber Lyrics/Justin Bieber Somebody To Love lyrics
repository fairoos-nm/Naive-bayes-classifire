 For you, I'd write a symphonyI'd tell the violin
It's time to sink or swim
Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be
Running a thousand miles
Just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot
But for I admit I
I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Giving you all this attention
Baby listen
I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much
Just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need anything else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
Every day
I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds
Smile for me
I would take
Every seconds, every single time
Spend it like my last dime
Step to the beat of my hear
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I admit I
I rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Givin' you all this attention
Baby listen
I just need somebody to love
I, I don't need to much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love
I need somebody
I, I need somebody
I need somebody
I, I need somebody to love
And you can have it all
Anything you want
I can bring; give you the finer things, yeah
But what I really want
I can't find cause
Money can't find me
Somebody to love (oh oh)
Find me somebody to love
I need somebody to love
I, I don't need too much
Just somebody to love
Somebody to love

Somebody to love
