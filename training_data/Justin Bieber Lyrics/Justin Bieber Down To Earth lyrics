 Ohhh, ohhh, oh
I never thought that it'd be easy
Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering howNo one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart.
So we fight, (so we fight)Through the hurt, (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live, (and we live)
And we learn, (and we learn)And we try and try and try and try!
So its up to you, (oh)
And its up to me, (yeah)
and we meet in the middle, on our way back down to earthDown to earth, down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earthBack down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earthBack down to earth
Back down to earthBack down to earth
Mommy, you were always somewhere
And Daddy, I live out of town
So tell me how could I ever be, normal somehow?You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears?
(Woo) so far away and now I just need you here
So we fight, (so we fight)Through the hurt, (through the hurt)
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
And we live, (and we live)
And we learn, (and we learn)And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you
And its up to me
And we meet in the middleon our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earthOn our way back down to earth
(on our way back down to earth)
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Back down to earth
Fell so far away
Where we used to be
Now were standing and where do we go
When there's no road
To get to your heart
Let's start over again
So it's up to you
And its up to me
And we meet in the middle
on our way back down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
I never thought it would be easy
Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wonder how...
