 Yeah, yeah, yeah
Happy birthdayThat hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on
Tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, yeah hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me goDon't let this go to your head
But you're the best I've ever had
Not to mention
That thing is swollen
You got me oh so in a trance
Something like a ziploc
Put our lips locked
Want you wrapped around my arm
Like a wrist watch
Oh so hard walking out
Got me stuck like crazy glueThat hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on
Tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, yeah hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me goGot me tossing turning in the bed
Your place is where I'd rather be instead
You don't know your strength
Missing you is like adrenaline
Ooh when you got me in a gridlock
What a great spot
With a turned up kind of loving
It just won't stop
No, so hard walking out
Got me stuck like crazy glue
Ooh-weeThat hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on
Tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, yeah hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me goHolding back the faces I would make
I'm a fan and you're the rockstar
Making it hard on me
Visualize a monster
But you're too bad for me
Shot that arrow I'm hit
Need you right near me
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn away
I try to maintain
So don't mind if I turn awayThat hold on tight
Yeah that hold on tight
Ooh that hold on
Tight
Them lips won't let me go
Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go oh
Hold on tight
Yeah hold on tight, yeah hold on tight
Ooh that hold on tight
Them lips won't let me go
