 Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
Ooh, is it ever gonna be?
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
To accept all responsability
I'd go out of my way
To live by the words that you say
I don't wanna be the sameMaybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right
Change me, change meDon't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quiter
Understanding and patience
Feel the pain that I'm facing
Be like Serenity
Help me position my mindTake a chance
Make a difference in my life
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could be the light
That opens up my eyesMake all my wrongs right
Change me, change me
Girl, I'm ready, if you're ready, now
Ooh, is it ever gonna be?
If you're with it, then I'm with it, now
