 Eenie meenie miney mo
Catch a bad chick by her toe
If she holla (if, if, if, she hollas) let her goShe's indecisive
She can't decide
She keeps on lookin'
From left to right
Girl, c'mon get closer
Look in my eyes
Searching is so wrong
I'm Mr. RightYou seem like the type
To love 'em and leave 'em
And disappear right after the song
So give me the night
To show you, and hold you
Don't leave me out here dancin' aloneYou can't make up your mind, mind, mind, mind, mind
Please don't waste my time, time, time, time, time
I'm not tryin' to rewind, wind, wind, wind, wind, wind
I wish our hearts could come together as one
