 I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to meGirl it's getting late, the sun's going down
and its about the time to shake my way cross the town
But before I go, I just wanna say
That you stay on my mind each and everydayI think I'm starting to like
The time that we spend
and its building inside
then I can't pretendNo I don't wanna fight it, I don't wanna hide the way I feel
So I guess it's time for me to say
That I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be togetherAnd if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better
Cause on nights like this, its good to know that you got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say, 'Hope this will last forever'Don't know if is love, it's too early to say
But if it's something like it I just want it to remain
Don't know if you're the one, that takes a little time
But in the mean time, girl you're feeling just fine
Cause the way you look at me, never seen that look before
And if it's a hint of what's to come then baby can i get some more?Not trying to be too forward, but i think its best for you to know
I got eyes for you baby, I want us to be togetherAnd if you feel it too, tell me, no one will treat you better
Cause on nights like this, its good to know that you got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say, 'Hope this will last forever'I think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!
Think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!
Think I found my girl, if it's you then speak to meI think I found my girl, if it's you then holla!
