tell me, how the fuck we supposed to stay friends
when you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
i could tell, i could tell, i could tell
certain people don't like me no more
new shit don't excite me no more
guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more
uh, you can look me in my eyes and see i ain't myself
cause if y'all what i created then i hate myself
but still, let them girls in and tell them all
leave their cell phones on the table where we see them
i'm all day with it man, a.m to the p.m
niggas hating, i just wish that they would say it when they see 'em[Justin Bieber]

looking for some things and i think that i can find them in you, in you
