 Feeling the remnants, got it in an instance
Blink of an eye, no goodbye
I had a notion deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky, oh myLike a permanent stain wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain?
For all the pain?If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been youThere are percussions, I'm missing your loving
Must be the night, the ghost of a life
All of the memories
A serenity dwindling my mind
All the timeLike a permanent stain wishing I could just wash away, away
Prayed our love wasn't vain
Who was to blame for all the pain?
For all the pain?If I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been youIf I would've known, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you
If I had the chance, if I had the chance I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be, wanted to be your enemy
No, but if I, if I would've known
If I would have known it could have been you, been you
