 Come here
I don't know what happenedWhere did they go?
Nights like this don't happen anymore
I need to know
Is it me? and did I lose control?Lonely over seas
Lonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyesRoller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling downIt's been difficult
I'm just happy there's no fights no more
But it's nights like this that I never ever missed you more
If there's a reason why this happens forLonely over seas
Lonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyesRoller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling downLonely over seasLonely memories
Wish I had the key to your heart
People come and go
Baby, they don't know
What we had before
What it felt before our eyes
Roller coaster, roller coaster
Spinning all around and around for a while baby
Roller coaster, roller coaster
For a minute we were up, but the next we were falling down
