 You worked two jobs
To keep a roof up over our heads
You chose a life for me, no you never gave up
I admire you for the strength you've instilled in meYou were so young
You were just my age when you had me
Mom, you were so brave
There was nothing that would stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for meSo when you're lost and you're tiredWhen you're broken in twoLet my love take you higherCause I, I still turn to youI still turn to youI still turn to youIt was '94
The year that everything started to change
From before
You had to be a woman and
You were forced to change your ways
To change your waysThen you found the LordYou gave your life to Him
And you could not ignoreThe love He had for you
And now He wanted more of your heartSo when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I, I still turn to youI don't know what I'd do if you left meSo please don't go awayEverything that you are is who I amWho I am todaySo when you're lost and you're tiredWhen you're broken in twoLet my love take you higherCause I, I still turn to you
To you, to you
I still turn to you
To you, to you
'Cause I, I turn to you
I still turn to you'Cause I, I turn to you
