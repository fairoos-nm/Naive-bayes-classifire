 Sometimes it's hard to face reality
(Oh oh)
Even though you might get mad at me
(Oh oh)
Sometimes it's hard to face realityDon't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside the door alone
I know it's hard to work from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talking to your significant other all night longSometimes it's hard to face reality
(Oh oh)
Even though you might get mad at me
(Oh oh)
Sometimes it's hard to face realityShould've been adjusted to my life
Had the oppurtunity to stay away from the last time
Now you're standing right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Trying to protect your feelings
You've been in between the lines
Hope your heart is still in healingSometimes it's hard to face reality
(Oh oh)
Even though you might get mad at me
(Oh oh)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
