 It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoeI don't want to miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoeWith you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoeEveryone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chillin' with my folks, I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoeWord on the street Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer's flying thought the sky so high
I should be making a list I know
But I'mma be under the mistletoeWith you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoeWith you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoeEh, love, the wise men followed the star (the wise men followed the star)
The way I follow my heart
And it led me to a miracleEh love, don't you buy me nothing (don't you buy me nothing)
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry ChristmasIt's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow (I know)
But I'mma be under the mistletoeI don't want to miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'mma be under the mistletoeWith you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you
With you, under the mistletoe (oh yeah)With you, shawty with you
With you, shawty with you (oh yeah)
With you, under the mistletoe (under the mistletoe)Kiss me underneath the mistletoe (Kiss me underneath the mistletoe)
Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh (oh-oh-oh-ohh)
Oh, oh, ohhh (oh-oh-oh-ohh)Kiss me underneath the mistletoe (Kiss me underneath the mistletoe)
Show me baby that you love me so-oh-oh (ooohhh)
