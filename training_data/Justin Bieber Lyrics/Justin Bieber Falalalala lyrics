 It's that time, I hear you can give it,
Give it, give it, give it all
One through the note your list you can get it,
Get it, get it, get it now
Make your wish tonight
When you open your eyes
When the lights go bright girl
I'll be right thereBaby you deserve everything you want
It's your night, ohhh
When I put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Know that it's christmas timeYou got on my favorite dress
You're looking, looking, looking, good
Snow falling on your hair, and I don't, I don't
Wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
Wanna be your biggest giftBaby you deserve everything you want
It's your night, ohhh
Wanna put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Know that it's christmas timeI'll deck your heart with bows of holly
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby cuz you're the reason to be jolly.
Fa la la la la, fa la la la laI hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Know that it's christmas timeFa la la la la, fa la la la la
Like christmas
Know that it's christmas time
Fa la la la la, fa la la la laKnow that it's christmas time...
