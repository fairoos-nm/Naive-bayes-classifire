 BloodPopI was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems
I'm just curious 'bout her, honestKnow your wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so goodSo I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Can we still be friends? (ah-ah)
Doesn't have to end (ah-ah)
And if it ends
Can we be friends?Can we be friends?

To hold you tighter since I left
Wonderin' if you think about me
