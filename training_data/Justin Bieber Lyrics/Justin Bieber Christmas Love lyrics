 Baby I will not pout
Baby I will not cry
'Cause I got your love this Christmas timeWhen the snow's on the ground
And it's freezing outside
I got your love this ChristmasOn every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
Warm me up, with your Christmas loveHey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own Christmas loveTell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above
For my very own Christmas love, yeahLike a beautiful tree
You can light up the room
But your kinda star can't be removedLike a beautiful carol
I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing alongOn every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest
And warm me up, with your Christmas loveHey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one
You're my very own Christmas loveTell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above
For my very own Christmas loveAll the lovers around the world (all the lovers)
Let me sing you Merry Merry Christmas

Stay close to the ones you love
And thank God aboveThat you got someone this year
