 Come they told me, pa rum pa pum pum
A newborn king to see, pa rum pa pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pa pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pumRum pa pa pum, rum pa pum pum pum pum
Yeah I'm on the drum, yeah I'm on the snare drum
Yeah I'm on the beat cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat cause I'm playin' for the SonPlayin' for the King, playin for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight, I might go psycho
Christmas time so here's a recitalI'm so bad like Michael,
I know I'm still young but I go, I go
Stupid stupid love like cupid
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do itLittle baby, pa rum pa pum pum
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pa pum pumGather round the mistletoe real quickI have no gifts to bring, pa rum pa pum pumMatter of fact, let's gather round the fireplace; it's about to get hot in hereThat's fit to give our kingBieber what up!Pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pumLemme get straight to itYo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
Blackberry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the TwitterThen I hit him back despite I had some food up on my finger
Sippin' eggnog with a little sprinkle of vanilla,
Even though it's kinda cold, pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter."
I said, "Cool."Ya know Imma deliver; let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' nowPeople everywhere and all our Twitter followers
"Merry Christmas, Kwanza, happy Hanukkah! "Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum, yeah, yeah
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, yeahIf you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food; it's not fairIt's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they warm by the fire, getting toys and their dollsNot thinking there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe
Globe globe globe globe globeI'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it
