 Feeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've keptI put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reachAnd you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purposeThinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent
my spirit's at easeI put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reachAnd you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every wayOh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everythingI don't know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it's wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again. We weren't necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisionsYou can't be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that's not who you are. You know you're trying to be the best you can be, but that's all you can do. If you don't give it all you got, you're only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happeningThat's what happening with me, it's like "God, I'm giving it all I've got, sometimes I'm weak and I'm going to do it." And it's like I'm not giving myself grace, I'm just like understanding that's how it is
