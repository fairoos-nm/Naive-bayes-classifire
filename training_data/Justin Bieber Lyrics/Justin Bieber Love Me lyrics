 This JBMy friends say I'm a fool to think
That you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for loveCause honestly the truth is that
You know I'm never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from aboveBaby you can do no wrong
My money is yours
Give you little more because I love you, love you
With me, girl, is where you belong
Just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above you. above youLove me, Love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you (love me)
Love me, love me
Say that you love me
Fool me, fool me
Oh how you do me
Kiss me, kiss me
Say that you miss me
Tell me what I wanna hear
Tell me you love mePeople try to tell me
But I still refuse to listen
Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your loveBaby you can do no wrong
