 You worked two jobs
To keep a roof up over our heads
You chose life for me
No you never gave up
I admire you for the strength you instilled in meYou were so young
You were just my age when you had me
Mom, you were so brave
There was nothing that would stop or get in our way
And I know you will always be there for meSo when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I still turn to you
I still turn to you
I still turn to youIt was '94
The year that everything started to change
From before, You had to be a woman
You were forced to change your ways
To change your waysThen you found the Lord
You gave your life to Him
And you could not ignore
The love he had for you
And I wanted more of your heartSo when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I still turn to you.I don't know what I'd do if you left me
So please don't go away
Everything that you are is who I am
Who I am today.So when you're lost and you're tired
When you're broken in two
Let my love take you higher
Cause I still turn to you
I still turn to you
I still turn to youCause I, I turn to you
