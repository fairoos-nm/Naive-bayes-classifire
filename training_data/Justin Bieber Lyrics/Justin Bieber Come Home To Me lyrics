 Come home to me so that i can love you
Come home to me so that i can talk to you
Back into my arms is were you should be
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far awayTV light of blue and white
I just can't fall asleep at night
Move over to the space where you should be
Even half way seem so far
Over mountains and diamond stars
Everybody has their own way homeCome home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far awayAll my life I've dreamed of love
Never thought it would hurt this much
To kiss goodbye and wait for your return, ohh
So I'll be strong and hold on to
The picture and the thought of you
Getting all the love that you deserveCome home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Home is way too far awayIf home is where you are
Then home is way too far away
