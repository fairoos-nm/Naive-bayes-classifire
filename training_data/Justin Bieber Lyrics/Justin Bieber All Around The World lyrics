Dynamic duo is back at it!
JB, Luda!!
I love everything about you,
You're imperfectly perfect!
Everyone's itching for beauty
But just scratching the surface.
Lost time is never found,
Can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change
Make every second worth it
Anything could work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it then don't give in
Cause hate may win some battles,
But love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun
While the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right thatAll around the world

All around the world
They're no different then us
