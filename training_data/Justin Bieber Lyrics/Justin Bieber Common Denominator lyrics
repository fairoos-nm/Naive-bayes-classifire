 Just a fraction of you love
Fills the air
And I fall in love with you
All over again
You're the light that feeds the sun
In my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain
For my girlOut of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here (woah)
I don't want to go backTo just being one half
Of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Girl, with out you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
(oh, oh, ooh, oh)
You're the common denominator
(oh, oh, ooh, oh)Before your love was low
Playing girls was my height
You changed the game that would put
My card in the sideWhen broken hearts rise up to say
Love is a lieYou and I will stand to be
Loves reply (yeah)
Out of all the things in life
That I could fear (yeah)
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here
Here, here, yeah yeahI don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equationYou understand what I'm sayin?
Girl, with out you I'm lostCan't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator
(oh, oh, ooh, oh)
You're the common denominator
(oh, oh, ooh, oh)I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give
Can fill me upAnd through all the heart achin
Jealous females hatin
Imma hold it down for you
You
woah

I don't wanna go back
To just being one half
Of the equation (half of the equation)
Do you understand what I'm sayin?
Girl without you I'm lost
Can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator

Fills the air
And I fall in love with you
