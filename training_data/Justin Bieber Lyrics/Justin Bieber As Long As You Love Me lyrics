 As long as you love me...
As long as you love me...
As long as you love me...We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know, girl
We both know it's a cruel worldBut I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving
We could be homeless
We could be brokeAs long as you love meI'll be your platinum
I'll be your silver
I'll be your gold
As long as youLove me
Love meAs long as you
Love me
Love meI'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day
For your dreams, girlI'll be your hova
You can be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress, and don't cry
We don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand
As long as you love me
We could be starving
We could be homeless
We could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum
I'll be your silver
I'll be your gold
As long as you
Love meLove me
As long as you
Love me
Love meI don't know if this makes sense, but
You're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place
I'll rendezvous it, I'll fly to it
I'll beat you there
Girl, you know I got you
Us, trust, a couple things
I can't spell without you
Now, we on top of the world
'Cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit
Now, the sky's our point-of-view
Man, now, we stepping out like
"Whoa!" (Oh God!)
Cameras point and shoot
Ask me what's my best side
I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with
Feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But, the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So, I know we got issues, baby
True, true, true
But, I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me
We could be starving
We could be homeless
We could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum
I'll be your silver
I'll be your gold
(As long as you love me)
As long as you love, oh, oh, oh
(As long as you love me)
As long as you love, oh, oh, oh
(As long as you love me)
I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
(As long as you love me)
You love me, you love me
It's what I want, baby
(Baby, your love)
You love me, me
Oh, girl
(No, no, no, no)
As long as you love me
