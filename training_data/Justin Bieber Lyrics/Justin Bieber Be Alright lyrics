 Ooh, ooh
Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your faceI need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road and upside down now
I know it's hard babe, to sleep at night
Don't you worry,'Cause everything's gonna be alright ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright ai-ai-ai-aightThrough the sorrow a
And the fights
Don't you worry'Cause everything's gonna be alright ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright ai-ai-ai-aightAll alone, in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
Anf for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms, holding my heart
Oh I,
Oh I,
I love you
And everything's gonna be alright ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright ai-ai-ai-aight
Through the long nights
And the bright lights
Don't you worry,
'Cause everything's gonna be alright ai-ai-ai-aight
Be alright ai-ai-ai-aight
You know that I care for you,
I'll always be there for you
I promise I'll just stay right here, yeah
I know that you want me to,
Baby we can make it through, anything
'Cause everything's gonna be alright ai-aight
Be alright, ai-aight
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, cause everything's gonna be alright ai-aight
Be alright, ai-aight
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, cause everything's gonna be alright
