 You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going that's when nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love
I'm just trying to be cool, cool, cool, trying to be cool
What you expect me to do? Oh, oh, oh, yeah
I'm just trying to find, find, find
Sweet love of mineI'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not giving up
I'd give it all up for us, it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
See my baby really needs some help
'Cause she can never stay at home by herself
She says she needs a little company
Even if she's not always with me, yeah, oh
I'm just trying to be cool, cool, coolWhat you expect me to do? Oh yeah
I'm just trying to find, find, find
Sweet love of mine

Why can't I find the love of mine
When you're standing right in front of my face?
Oh why? I must be blind
How did I let you get away? Yeah, yeah
