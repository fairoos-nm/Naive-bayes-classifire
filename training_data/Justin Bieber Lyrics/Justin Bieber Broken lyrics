 I guess they want a reaction
But I ain't gonna give it to em'
Yeah, they tryna get at me, yeah
But I ain't gonna feed in to it
Oh they be persistent, tryna break me down
Oh I can not be broken
I cannot be broken
Oh I cannot be broken
I cannot be brokenThey can't take what's mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Oh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hopin'
(Hopin' you would change me)
(Hopin' you would make me lose my mind)
Way too strong for that
You know you were wrong for that
So keep on chasing that 458
Got that cruise on the smooth highway
I ain't even tryna get away, (I'm good)They try to break me
Oh I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken, oh oh
Oh I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
They can't take what's mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Oh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hopingHoping and praying I really won't make it
All of these dreams, they tried to forsake me
How you gon' play me? How you gon' break me?
I've been in this ish since diapers and babies
All my life, been driving them crazy
There go the Blakey, thought of them ladies
Dreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes
Living the life, the life is so crazy
I need some cameras, honeys and ladies
How you expect me not to go crazy
Never been lazy, never been shady
Lost a few friends, the moneys still gravy
We da new stars, that's why they still hatin'
Money up front, we never be waitin'
Save some and invest some
Just let my money be patient
It's a cold world that we live in
Diamonds all in my pendant
They wish Satan tellers
Was in it
Then they'd pray for me to be finished
Them haters gon' start trippin'
When you don't pay them no attention
And the obstacle I might face
I guarantee that I kill it! (Ah)Ooh I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken
I cannot be broken
They can't take what's mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Ooh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping
