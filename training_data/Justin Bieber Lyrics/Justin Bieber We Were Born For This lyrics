 Look at all the choices
The choices in this world
World spreading no freedom
Freedom for the boys and the girlsBut the boys and the girls
They don't know
What love is like
Love is like appreciation
Mixed in a double cup of spriteSo can we go
No left or right
You go your way
And ill go mineCuz this is my time
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say
Cuz I'm here to stayCuz this is my time
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say
Cuz I'm here to stayLook at all the places
Places that I've been
It doesn't come easy
You gotta have strength
And when it goes down
And it's all said and doneYou gotta stand up to them
There's no need to run
And now that I've made it
I won't look back no
Sacrifice what meant the most to me
The most to me
Yes I didCuz this is my time
And I won't waste it thinking about what you gotta say
Cuz I'm here to stayLook at all the people standing outside
So dedicated
Your love doesn't go unrecognized
Your love doesn't go unrecognized
