 [Intro]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you[Verse 1]
Get a little closer to me too
I get a little shy when we start to move
I get a little high when I'm tryna decide if it's London or China too
Forget about the plans that you got, baby
Kiss me like you can't have too many
The Earth is like 'round and 'round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know[Pre-Chorus]
So in the meantime, I'm living and I'm gonna love
Because you choose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above[Chorus]
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, 'cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love[Hook]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you[Verse 2]
Get a little excited from across the room
I just can't seem to keep my eyes off you
Smile at me, so I smile at you
Then you feel so loved, when I dance with you
Tonight the way that you're moving
Make me wanna lose it
Round and 'round we go
When it's gon' stop, you never know[Pre-Chorus]
So in the meantime I'm living, and I'm gonna love
Because you choose me, I'm walkin' cloud 9 above[Chorus]
Baby's in love
Baby's on top, never gon' stop to get what she wants
Whatever she want, givin' it up, 'cause baby's in love
Baby don't need anything more than just what I got
Baby's in love[Hook]
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
Something about that makes me wanna dance
Something about that makes me wanna move
Something about that makes me wanna get down and get closer to you
