 Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safeAnd then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our handsOur love is here to staySo get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
There ain't a moment
I won't need your brace
Get used to me touching you
Get used to me loving you
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, eh
Oh get used to it, oh and oh
Get used to me holding youGet used to me woeing you
Oh get used to itAnd I'ma April shower you
Forever if I May
'Til your flowers bloom in June
Make sure that our fireworksBe your 4th of July
For life
As long as you stand right by my sideKeep growing closerThroughout October
Oh counting down, it's almost Christmas Eve
Oh seven days shy of New Year's Eve
Then we'll be celebratingSo get used to me checking in
All day
Get used to me falling through
Just to see your face
