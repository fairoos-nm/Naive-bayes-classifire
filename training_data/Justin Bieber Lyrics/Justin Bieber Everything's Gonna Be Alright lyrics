 Across the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face
I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and
Through the clouds
Bumps in the road and
Upside down
I know it's hard babe
To sleep at night
Don't you worry
'Cause everythings gonna be alright, I
Be alright, I
Through your sorrow,
In the fights
Dont you worry
'Cause everythings gonna be alright, I
Be alright, I
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms,
Holding my heart
Oh I, Oh I
I love you
And everythings gonna be alright, I
Be alright, I
Through the long nights,
And the bright lights
Don't you worry babe,
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, I
Be alright, I
You know that I care for you
Ill always be there for you
Promise I will stay right here
I know that you want me too
Baby we can make it through anything
Cause everythings gonna be alright, I
Be alright, I
Through the sorrow,
In the fights,
Don't you worry
'Cause everythings gonna be alright
Be alright, I
Through the sorrow,
In the fights,
Don't you worry
'Cause everythings gonna be alright
