 I keep thinking in my head that one day we'll separate
I see it happening everyday, nothing lasts forever
That's what people say
I can't picture you out of my life
I think about this every day and night
And I don't know why but it seems to get to me
No, I don't wanna leave you, I'm no good alone
So I'm staying with you till you want me to goGirl, you don't understand what you do to me
Got crazy in my head, I don't think I can leave
I need you here with me all night
Girl, I can't live without your smile
I'm in love, I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm in love, I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm in love, I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm, I'm in loveI'm so scared to lose you
Uuh, uh, oh oh
Don't know what I would do
Thought of me being replaced
Brings tears right to my face
And I can't think of anybody who would take your place
No, I don't wanna leave you, I'm no good alone
So I'm staying with you till you want me to goGirl, you don't understand what you do to me
Got crazy in my head, I don't think I can leave
I need you here with me all night
Girl, I can't live without your smile
I'm in love, I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
I'm in love, I don't know what to do
But I'm crazy over you
