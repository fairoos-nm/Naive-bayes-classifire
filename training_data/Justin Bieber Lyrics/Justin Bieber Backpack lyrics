 You said "I come in peace" so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave 'cause you feel aloneYou don't know what they're like
If they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listenDon't try to find your spaceship
It might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
(You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting, I can't stay in your backpack forever)Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was
You taught how to dream and how to love
You're my best friend please listen to meYou don't know what they're like
If they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listenDon't try to find your spaceship
It might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
(You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting, I can't stay in your backpack forever)Greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I've only taking over this planet since I arrived
I'm in a backpack, I'm ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne's worldDon't try to find your spaceship
It might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
(You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet's outside there waiting, I can't stay in your backpack forever)On our planet we don't kill one another
We don't take love for granted
It's a gift from the mother
In your planet, you are filled with greed and false belief
We came here to bring you peace
