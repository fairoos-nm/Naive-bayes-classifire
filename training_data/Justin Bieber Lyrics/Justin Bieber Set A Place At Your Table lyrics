 Things seem strange this morning
As i packed my bag for school
The smiles I'm used to seeing just weren't there
I heard my faither talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that i could hear... wasSet a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at the table
There's a little hope for you and II was feeling kinda' helpless
About the words that i just heard
Could it be the family 2 doors down?
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up agaisnt the wall
And thought it may seem small
I know theres somethin' i can doSet a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and IMake room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day, just laugh talk and eatSet a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes up, put their feet up
Forget about their trouble for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and i...There's a little hope for you and i
