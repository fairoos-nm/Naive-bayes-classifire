 Ooh ooh ooooh
Ooh ooh ooooh
Ooh ooh ooooh
And I prayI just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers
It's on the TV
It's everywhere that I go
Children are cryin'
Soldiers are dyin'
Some people don't have a homeBut I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain, hey
Can you tell me how I can make a change?I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and prayI lose my appetite
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner, 'cause half my dinner is still there on my plate?
Ooh, I got a vision to make a difference
And it's starting today'Cause I know there's sunshine beyond that rain
I know there's good times beyond that pain, hey
Heaven, tell me how I can make a change?I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes andI pray for the brokenhearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the ones not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need, I pray
Can you give 'em one today?I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change?
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and
I pray
I pray
I pray
I close my eyes and pray
