 Happy birthdayYou ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we areIf it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain't never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question itYou ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we areIt's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothing right into something
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They ain't ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question itYou ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary (yeah)
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't wanna lose, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we areShe texts me "How's you love life?"
And "How are you?", I said "I'm good"
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
EscoYou ain't gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary, yeah
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't wanna lose, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
