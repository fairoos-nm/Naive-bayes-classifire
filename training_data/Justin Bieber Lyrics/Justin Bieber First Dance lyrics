 First Dance - Justin Bieber Ft. Usher
It's your chance take her hand to the floor
(fellas just the moment you've been waiting for)
Girl if you see something you like then let 'em know
(ladies I know your ready)
Cuz you only got one chance
(yeah yeah)
For your first dance(you never forget bout your first dance)
So take advantage of the slow jam
Yeah, manWhen I close my eyes
I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so longFor this day to come
Now that its here
Let's make it special(I can't deny)
There's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite songAin't no chaperones
This could be the night of your dreams
Only if you give, give the first dance to meGirl I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to meI'm gonna' cherish every moment
'Cuz it only happens once, once in a lifetime
I couldn't ask for moreWe're rocking back and forth
Under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor(I can't deny)
There's so many thought in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song (favorite song)
Now we're all alone (all alone)Here's the opportunity
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle
I know we gotta do it slowlyIf you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gonna' cherish every moment
Cuz it only happens once once in a lifetimeEverybody says that we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing closeI'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up
And the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip glossYour glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine
If you just give give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle
(I know) But we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
(give the first dance baby)
I'm gonna' cherish every moment
Cuz it only happens once, once in a lifetime
It's your chance take her hand to the floor (to the floor)
Girl, if you see something you like then let 'em know
Cuz you only got one chance, for your first dance
So take advantage of this slow down
Yeah man.
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gonna' cherish every moment
Cuz it only happens once, once in a lifetime
