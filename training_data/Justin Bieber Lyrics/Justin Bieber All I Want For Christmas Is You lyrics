 I don't want a lot for ChristmasThere is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stockingThere upon the fireplace
Santa Claus wont make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my ownMore than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is youuuuuu
Youuuuuu babyOhh oh I wont ask for much this Christmas
I wont even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoeI wont make a list and sand it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I wont even stay awake to
Here those magic reindeers click'Cause I just want you here tonight
Hold in on to me so tight
What more can I do
'Cause baby
All I want for Christmas is youuuuuu
Youuuuuu baby
Ohhh oh
All the lights are shining so brightly everywhere
And the sounds of children
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me? Yeah
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh baby
All I want for Christmas iiiiis youuuuuu
That's all I want for Christmas, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
