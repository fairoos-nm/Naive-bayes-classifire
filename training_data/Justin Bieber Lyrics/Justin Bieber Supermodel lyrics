 [Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You could be my supermodel
You could be my supermodel
You could be my supermodel
Oh, the way you strut your shit
You could be my supermodel
Ooh, I wanna take your pic[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Oh, it's like 3 in the morning
And you see me lookin' at you
Ooh, I just can't control it
Come over here so I can see you better
I don't want you to leave
Baby, you and me should be together
Spend the night with me, yeah[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm talkin' 'bout first class treatment babe
Startin' this evening baby
Tell me what you need and I'll pay
Even though I know that you don't need anything
I'm talkin' 'bout first class treatment babe
Startin' this evening baby
Tell me what you need and I'll pay
Even though I know that you don't need anything[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You could be my supermodel
The way you strut your shit
You could be my supermodel
Ooh, I wanna take your pic[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I could pick you up in a Rolls Royce
Anywhere you wanna go, it's your choice
I promise that I'm nothing like them other boys
Soundz drop that beat just to make noise
Just to make noise
Soundz drop that beat just to make noise
Just to make noise
Soundz drop that beat just to make noise[Pre-Chorus: Justin Bieber]
I'm talking bout first class treatment babe
Starting this evening baby
Tell me what you need and I'll pay
Even though I know that you don't need anything
I'm talking bout first class treatment babe
Starting this evening baby
Tell me what you need and I'll pay
Even though I know that you don't need anything[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You could be my supermodel
The way you strut your shit
You could be my supermodel
Ooh I wanna take your pic[Verse 3: Tyga]
Pretty I mean pretty exactly where I'm from
You still with me?
I'm your new bad boy ball no biggiePop it on the collar
I just pull up and park like play grounding
Bet you do anything for a one nighter
Bet I can make your friend freak like cirque du soleil...
