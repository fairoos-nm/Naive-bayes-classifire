(I Get em up)
F-ck it I'm on one
(I Get em up)
I said I'm on oneDJ KhaledI'm getting so cold
I aint went this hard since I was 18
Apologize if I say, anything I don't mean
Like whats up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me
And whats up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easyBut get it while you here boy
Cause all that hype don't feel the same next year boy
Yeah and I'll be right here in my spot with a little more cash than I already got
Trippin off you cause you had your shot
With my skin tanned and my hair long
And my fans who been so patient, me and 40 back to work but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate the bullshit
Hate these fucking allegations, I'm just feeling like the throne is for the taking
Watch me take it!All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it till it's done
And I don't really give a f-ck, and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older so somebody shoulda told yaI'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, I'm on one
Yeah, I said I'm on one
Fuck it, I'm on oneTwo white cups and I got that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and imma get that shitCause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on oneI'm burning purple flowers
It's burning my chest
I bury the most cash and burning the rest
(STUNTIN)
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air
(YEAH)
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear
(CHECK ME)
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills
(BOSS)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
(WOO)
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya everything is great
(RIGHT)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facin' 8
Still running with the same niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully
(HAHA)
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams
(WOO)
In a room full of money out in London
(WOO)
and she screams
(WOO)
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feeling ain't fair (Khaled)
