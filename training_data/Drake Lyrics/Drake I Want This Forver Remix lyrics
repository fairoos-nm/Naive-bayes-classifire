 It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayneI'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayneLast name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy, I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know g4 pilots on a first name basisIn your city faded off the brown nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I bald, KimoDropped a mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a country-wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside an X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without oneYeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness, bitchesIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayneI'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayneI used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I could make it rain all springY'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues for me
Old money Benjamin Button, what? I nuttingNow superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no, you fucking wasn'tYou're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny packChasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and goddamn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, you can have it backIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayneI'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayneOkay, hello, it's da Martian, space jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New OrleansAnd I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is like a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme parkMy minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil' Wayne, that's what they got to say or mentionI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as lastIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, mayneI'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, mayneThere they go, back in stadiums as shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Boso's
He's wondering if he should spit this slowFuck, no go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his noseBack into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goesThe passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about
When we riotYou dealing with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings, till our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind itPayback muthafucka for the way you got at
Me so how's it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass
So loud that it shakes the placeI'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this placeSo play some Drake
