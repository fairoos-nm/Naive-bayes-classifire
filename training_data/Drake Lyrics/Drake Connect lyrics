 Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing
How every conversation starts with this time will be different
Oh the ideas is fun, oh the ideas is fun
Oh the idea is soooo fun everytime
At least we try for a run everytime
Swanging, eyes closed just swangingSame city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're looking
I'll be here just swanging
Don't talk to me like I'm famous
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'
She just wanna run around the city and make memories that she can barely rememberAnd I'd allow herTalk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelin's like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler
And I'd allow her
Talk about pussy power
She used to say
"You can be whoever you want, believe in yourself"
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Cause you would learn to love people and use things, and not the other way around
Swanging, eyes closed just swangingSame city, same friends if you're looking for me
Same city, same friends if you're lookingI'll be here just swanging, (aye)
Don't talk to me like I'm famous (aye)
And don't assume cause I don't expect assumptions babe
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' babe
Swangin'
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she isShe call and tell me be here before the sun up I be dressed before we hung up
I take Englington to 401 East end
Exit at Malcom road and the East endWhere all the pretty girls are sleepin'
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin' for gas this late cause this nigga's creepin and I like how we're
creepin
Summer is comin' know you could feel it
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it
Won't knock on your door
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours."
I got the pedal to the floor
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'
