 Ayo blast that shit Maxx!
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Ayy[Verse 1]
UberX to Hidden Hills, give me somethin' I can feel
If they come to Hidden Hills then I know they know the deal
We just right there up the road, you could hit it wit' a stone
I be out here on my own, I'm just tryna set the tone
I've been kicked when I was down, none of that shit matter now
Niggas think they run the town 'til we run 'em out of town
And they gotta relocate, gotta dip from where they stay
Everything will be okay, man, just stay up out my way[Chorus]
Skit around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke[Interlude]
Ayo blast that shit Maxx!
Blast that shit back if you blastin'
Yeah, yeah[Verse 2]
Back and forth to Italy, my comment section killin' me
I swear I get so passionate, y'all do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys, we crashin' it and splashin' in
And when I say they crashin' it, I do not mean a accident
I'm- I'm still in the studio at 6:45
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride, I can't put that shit aside
I've been kicked when I was down, none of that shit matter now
They be throwin' in the towel, I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin' what they say, especially when it's to my face
Everything will be okay, man, just stay up out my way[Chorus]
Skit around ends with the bros and I'm kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros 'bout the opps that we know
But they can't take a joke, 'cause it's not one
Think it's 'cause we live by the code, reputation to uphold
Makin' me the one they gotta take the spot from
I be tryna laugh with the bros but they can't take a joke
