 [Intro]
Yeah they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me, yuh[Verse 1]
I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin' on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Guess I see the things that they wishin' on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, s*** was different with me[Chorus 1]
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't, yuh
I feel good, sometimes I don't, ay, don't
I finessed down Weston Road, ay, 'nessed
Might go down a G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, yu

I make sure that north-side eat
And still[Bridge]
Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me

That they wishin' and wishin' and wishin' and wishin'
They wishin' on me
Yuh, ay, ay[Verse 2]
She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly"
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry
Fifty dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3, dog
Without 40, Oli, there would be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies[Chorus 2]
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own, ay, no, ay
Someone watchin' this s*** close, yep, close

Might go down as G.O.D., yeah, wait
I go hard on Southside G, ay, wait
I make sure that north-side eat, yuh
And still[Bridge]
