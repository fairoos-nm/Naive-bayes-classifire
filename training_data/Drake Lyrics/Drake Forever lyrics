 It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand, nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mineLast name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local, but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basisAnd your city faded off to brown, Nino
She insists she got mo' class, we know
Swimmin' in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball, chemoDrop the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd've thought a countrywide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without oneYeah nigga, I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everybody who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness
BitchesIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineHey, ever, ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who we're about to killI used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all springY'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you could call it statutory
When a nigga blow up, they come build statues from meOld money Benjamin Button, what, nuttin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me, no you fucking wasn'tYou are such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny packChasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood, and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out, and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it backIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineOkay, hello it's da Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess, then I guess I'm just New OrleansAnd I would never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur, "To the top"
Life is such a fucking roller coaster, then it drops
But what should I scream for, this is my theme parkMy mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne, that's what they got to say or mentionI'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as lastIt may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineI shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mineThere they go, back in stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macadamia, they go so ballistic, whoa
We can make them look like Bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slowFuck no! Go for broke
His cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had a real buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his noseBack into the game, and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Who stand inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up out of our mouths, now rewind it!
Payback muthafucka for the way that you got at me
So how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case
You're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine
I shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mine, ever mine, ever mine, ever mine
