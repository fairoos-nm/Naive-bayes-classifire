 [Verse 1]
Uh
Black hearts on my cardigan
At the crib telling ya girl that we should order in
& tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than
Damn
I'm so catch-trina smarter than a lot of these niggas
Swear the coach just brought the starter in
Yeah and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things
I float high, don't try and cut my water winnnnggggs
I'm still myself, suicide bars I kill myself
Charge it to the game, I'll bill myself and
I don't feel ya'll but I feel myselllf
& to those tell em' I deserve a mazeltov
I'm rappin like a shepherd with the muzzle off
I'm next to blowâpause
And I can't hear the critics talking over the applause
Yeah
I tried to tell em', Future let em' know
Send the haters all my loveâX and O
I got a black box where suggestions go
But I don't really give a fuck
It's prolly best you know
My reality is brighter than ya dreams are
I got ya dream girl riding in ya dream car
Yeah and the visual is stunning
I hope they document what I'm becoming
Congratulations["oh" ad-libs][Verse 2]
So what you want an award or suttin?
I'm at the private airport boarding suttin'
I see nothin' from afar but I'm far from nothin'
Put on your poker face
I'll pull ya card if ya bluffinnnnn'
But I ain't with the hard talk
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull ya card and find out you're a Hallmark
Just know I'm breakin world recordsâno false start
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or suttin'
My deal like Weezy first weekâ1 point suttin'
And my verses getting stupider
Wayne if you're on Marsâcan you pick me up from Jupiterrrr?
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin off my cellular
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down
When I When I break it dow-ownnnn
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But you could never be my assâpause
Again, damnit ya'll? Again?
Ya'll, pretend that we are some men that get it on and in
I'll die before I lose, cause I was born to win
If he don't fuck with ya'll, then don't bother him
and yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them
Right... Uh["oh" ad-libs][Verse 3]
It's like
These days man, I'm booked and I'm busy
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothing but a protÃ©gÃ©
But if you watched the VMA's there's nothing more to sayyy
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like ya bought a poppy
and damn how I get so nice?
I just spent it all once bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch now it's on and poppin'
I always choose dough like it's my only option
Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow they say get it off your chestttt
And I'm what all the fuss about and if they talking
I bet I'm what they discussion bout
Hit me at the officeâsame extension
Consider me the reason ya'll should pay attention[Outro: Lil Wayne]
It's crack
A yo Drizzyâyou shoulda said that on the hook
You shoulda been like: "congratulations"
It's crack
Yeah
It's crack (ha ha)
Congratulations
Ladies and gentlemannn
