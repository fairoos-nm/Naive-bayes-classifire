 [Chorus]
(Ayy)
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
So much on my plate I gotta delegate
Baka passed a drug test, we gotta celebrate
I'm in better weight, thinkin' how'd I make-[Post-Chorus]
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be
(Yeah, yeah)[Verse: Drake & French Montana]
If you need me, you can't call me
I stay busy makin' money
You know what is on my mind
All I think about is hunnids
I stay busy (bzz!) workin' on me
I stay busy with my business, homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly, my mouth is goin' off, I don't know patience
I got a chance, then my niggas got it too like it's contagious
I see the future when I get wavy (wavy God!)
But I couldn't picture bein' Champagne when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldn't picture changes when I was with Ms. Craten
That lady hates me
Couldn't picture wifin' Braden when I was pumpin' gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldn't gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin' way harder than Satan
He's playin' favorites, it feels amazin' (yeah)[Chorus]
Elevate, elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This for life, bih, we can never separate
I'm in better weight, thinkin' how'd I make-[Post-Chorus]
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
There's no way that this is real, man, it can't be[Outro]
Yeah, I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me I begin to write the thesis
Freddy got the Aria setup like it's a Freaknik
Vegas like Marine Land, that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin'
My mood is changin' this summer I'ma be tweakin'
