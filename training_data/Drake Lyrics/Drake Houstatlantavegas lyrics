 Hey there, pretty girl
You know exactly what you got
And I don't blame you at all
You can't resist it
Especially when the lights so bright
And the money so right
And it's comin in every single night
She don't wanna leaveShe just stuck in
Houstatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas

Houstatlanta
She just stuck in
HoustatlantavegasHoustatlantavegas
Houstatlantavegas
HoustatlantavegasAnd she dance to this song
And she dance to this song and it go
Hey now now watch her go downShe doesn't ever worry
If she wants it she'll get it on her own
She knows there's more to life
And she's scared of ending up alone
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the airCuz the ones you throw will get her out of

And she dance to this song and it go
Hey now now watch her go down
We all got dreams and we all start reaching
All start peaking all-star weekend
One hotel room and all yall sleeping
Housekeeping knock to see if all yall decent
Young girls envy the life yall leading
Never satisfied with a nice calm evening
You be at the games looking right all season
But you always with me on the night yall leaving
Ass low ass low I always request you
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescueCarry you inside get you some water and undress you
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget
Who or Why or How or WhenTonight is probably about to happen all over again
Cuz she live in a mindset that I could never move to
Until you find yourself it's impossible to lose you
Uh, because I never had you
Although I would be glad to
I probably go and tattoo your name on my heart
I swear
I start
To think
That I'm going crazy
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her
Throw your ones up in the air
Cuz the ones you throw will get her out of
