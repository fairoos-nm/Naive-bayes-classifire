 R.I.P. to the girl you used to see./
Her days are over. Baby she's over./
I've decided to give you all of me./
Baby come closer, baby come closer./
I'm ready for ya!/
Kill 'em all, switch it up./
Put it on, zip it up./
Let my perfume, soak in in your sweater./
You say you'll be here soon, sooner the better./
No option for her, you sayin' no./
I run this game, just play your role./
Follow my lead, whatchu waitin' fo'?/
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night./
(Background voice)
Yeah I hear you talkin', don't know who you tryin' to flatter./
Got my mind made up. I-I-I'm ready for ya./
I'm in control, but with you bein' a man,/
You don't seem to understand that I-I-I'm ready for ya./
I-I-I'm ready for ya./
I-I-I'm ready for ya./
So keep thinkin' you the man,/
'Cause it's all part of my plan./
I-I-I'm ready for ya./
Nothin' on, I strut around./
I do it big, I shut it down./
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me./
Mental picture, no cameras please./(Background voice)
ca-ha-han you fee-hee-heel my ha-ha-ha-ha-heart is beatin'uh, red lipstick on the wine glass cameras in my mind,
flash, black lines aray white diamonds, what a contrast,
i know you get impatient as the time pass, you say you want it fast,
define fast, cause i can speed it up, and make it last
and i could audition for this, and i could be part of the cast
and i could produce for your future, i could co-direct your past,
and make damn sure you never forget it, commited, im ready, im with it
still here like a statue, pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos,
you say you got bagges, well im packed too, plus i got a sex pistol,
pointed right at you "BAM!", the baddest women ever in the heart of south,
proven over and over again thats why im hard to doubt, plus im
young money 'till the death, i took the carter route
im more than ready too, hope of something that you thought about
