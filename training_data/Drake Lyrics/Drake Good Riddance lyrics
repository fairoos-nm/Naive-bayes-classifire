 [Verse: Bishop Brigante]
It`s Fucking Losers Like You, That Make Me Do What I Do
Make Me Hate Where I`m From, You As Fake As They Come
Everybody Got Guns, Who The Fuck Gonna Squeeze
Everybody Got Sars, You Ain`t Fucking With These
Why You Wish To Be Ghetto, Tell Me What`s It About
Why You Trynna Get In Where I`m Trynna Get Out
Why Won`t You Just Be Yourself, Why Won`t You Tell Us The Truth
Like How You Only Load Guns When You Up In The Booth
You Ain`t Nothing To Shoot, You Don`t Even Exist
You Just A Fantasy, Family As Weak As It Gets
You Ain`t Speakin A Bitch, Cause I Don`t Listen To Chicks
I Don`t Argue With Broads, Cause I`m Really A Pimp
But I Will Tell You This, As Far As Y`all Are Concerned
Pull Out My Santa Clause, And Make The Holidays Burn
You Can Call Me The Grinch, Cause Y`all Are Nothing But Hoos
Just Another Bunch Of Phony Acts With Nothing To Prove[Verse: Ken Masters]
Ahaha Yo
Now Let The Kids Grill At The Rider`s Ride (Ride)
We Spending All Day, These Niggas Idolize (Aha)
They Claim They Want Fame Nigga So We Decided That We Gon Make `em Some Stars Until The Drama Dies
But They Can Go Back To They Holes Where They Mama Lies
Or Write More Lies About They Drugs, Guns Or Homicides

Run The Corner Then They Turn Into The Silent Type, Wanna Conpremise
My Niggas We Ride Or Die
And Roll With The Bitches That Got They Body Right

Time To Break A Nigga`s Spirit Like The Amistad, Trynna Fool The Audience (Who Run It)
Feel The Ambience, Stars In The Presence, Kings Of The City Are Appalled By The Peasants
Ain`t Gotta Say Names, We Can All Get A Reference
Brains In The Info From Your Broads In The West End
Masters, Flowing Staggers On Bars
Nigga Stay Mad Cause His Swagger`s On Mars
Y`all Niggas Ain`t Thinking We Callng Y`all Tards
Claim You Want War, Okay, On Guard[Verse: Young Tony]

Standing Out, Like A Sore Thumb To The D`s,
My Niggas Please, If You Really Had Work,
You Would Do What You Do And Wouldn`t Put It On Your Shirt,
It Makes My Heart Hurt When Dumb Niggas Act Hood,

No More Goodnight, Good Morning, Goodbye Niggas[Verse: Jd Era]
I Don`t Appreciate Niggas Sayin` My Name In They Bullshit
It`s Like Putting A Knife Against The Lyrical Full-Clip
Do Shit On My Own, I Never Asked For Help
If I Was Rapping Like Y`all I Woulda Killed Myself
And Naw This Ain`t Beef, It`s Missing A Few Ingredients
Dog You Ain`t General, Stick To Being Obedient
Piggy Back, That Ain`t Something I Had To Do
Laughing At Drake ? You Shoulda Seen How I Was Laughing At You
I Don`t Beef Over Little Shit, Angry ? A Little Bit
Little Niggas Get Little Recognition You Little Bitch
I Don`t Do The Little Subliminals, I`m Addressin` It
Littles Wanna Get In The Middle Then I`m Suggesting It
They Called You A Bitch, Were Trynna Act Out
They Challenge Him To A Fight And Then They Back Out
So Tell Me How The Fuck I Can Respect You Cats
If You A Gangsta, Then What Part Of The Game Is That ?[Verse: Drake]

And Try To Pull 17 Year Olds Down In Bramalea (I Know About It)And We Don`t Got It Out For You
We Just Saying That Don`t Nobody Vouch For You
Nope, Nobody Thorough Is Willing To Give A Cosign (Nobody)
And You Don`t Even Sell Blow, You Just Blow Time
You Can`t Even Get A Factor Grant
So Stop Rapping, Go Fix Parts At A Tractor Plant (Damn)And Listen Here Tetely T

And I Hear You Paying These Women And I Sex For Free (What Up Sweetheart)But Dog, How Did This Start
How We Get To This Part
We All Got Niggas Doing Bids Mr. Wishheart (What Up Cam)
It`s Not Cool To Use Another Nigga`s As A Threat Tho`
I Said You A Bitch, I Heard A Seven Man EchoYou Saying I Hustle, My Source For Currency Coke
They Saying You Never Moving It And Currently Broke
And You Risk Doing Crack Time And Hang Around Black Crime
Just So You Can Have Something To Say In You Rap LinesThey Say Drake Killed It Like Young Girls At A Private School (I Did)
Dog If I Were You, I Tell You What I Would Do
I Would Cut Ties With The Cops And Just Make Them Fire You
Lose The Body Pack And The Velcro You Feed The Wire Through
Tell Them Not To Call And That`s Even If They Require You
Cuz They The Only People Recording That Wanna Hire You (It`s True)
With What I Spend In A Weekend I Could Aquire You
Some Of Them Believe You Got Money You Little Liar YouBut, I Don`t Admire You Short Niggas Tell Tall Tales
Good Riddance Aristo I Just Retired You!
