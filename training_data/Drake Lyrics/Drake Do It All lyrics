 Somebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded, well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do itAnd I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
Probably why Im back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do itTonight I'm into breaking up
Somebody's home
I'm drunk as ever
I'm not alone, I, I, I, I, I'm with my people
I know you love it
I don't just do it
I over does it
I be getting money so long
Its just paper to me
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me
You can never reminisce when you forget it all
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all
Now my life is angel hair Pinot Grigio
Baby forget about it
Im headed wherever this muthf-cking jet is routed
You can't have my heart the doctor told me I'd be dead without it
My judgements never clouded
That's why I'm steady yelling weatherman weatherman
I'm about whatever man
I'm tryna f-ck with tinkerbell in never neverland
But I'm polite about it
Baby after you
I've had a glass or too soSomebody remind me where I am
Thats right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking it was youI was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do itAnd I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
Probably why I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do itTryna get the green like I'm waiting at a long light
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night
Where'd I just put my bow tie
Millionnaire multi
Rest in peace to BIG and praises to the most high
Getting stupid paid off of smart decisions
I'm the man now, I guess that parts a given
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition
I ask whats up and they just always say the cost of livin
I love from it though, I've been down and I got up
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light your spot up
And me falling and landing in love i dont think should happen
Becuase everythings easier to get into than get out off
But someone show me to the owner of this city
Cause the owners always seem to be the only people with me
I'm still the mafia, still run the commitee
NY forever n-gga, Diddy,Somebody remind me where I amThats right I'm at home, yeah I'm right where I belong
Girl you say you feeling faded well me too
The smoke is getting blown and the drinks is super strong
I know they aint getting money like we do
So it's on. I was looking for the one
Now I'm feeling dumb for thinking that it was you
I was wrong now I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I didWatch me do it
And I'mma do it all
Feeling like the old me
You don't even know me
I'mma do it all
I'mma do it all
Probably why I'm back up in this b-tch going harder than I did
Watch me do it
