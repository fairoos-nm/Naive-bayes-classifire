Everything didOh, you fancy, huh?You getting ready so I know we gon' be here awhile
In the bathroom, flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air milesHit the gym, step on the scales stare at the number
You say you dropping 10 pounds, preparing for summer
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice
You just do it for yourself, you're the fucking coldestIntelligent too, ooh, you're my sweetheart
I've always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past waysTime heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip-gloss in
And look, I really think that nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it togetherOh, you fancy, huh?

From all these superficial gold digging bitches in here
They get a baller, think that they ain't got to pick a career
Guess they plan on sucking dicks until some millions appearLike voila, you do it right, he just might buy you a car
Unless you play these suckers just like B.O.B play the guitar
Now here you are with your girls having drinks at the bar
I say I'm buying, you decline, that is kinda bizarreIndependent with the demeanor of an R 'n B singer
Make it ring finger, M3 beamer
Champagne Range, triple white Jag
Closet full of brand new clothes and handbagsAlexander McQueen, Prada, Gucci, Chanel
D&G, BCBG, Versace, Louie and Bebe
Ya ain't needy, greedy or easy as these other breezies
Who fuck for bottles of Riesling or beaus that beg zeebeeOh, you fancy, huh?

Go, go, go, go, go, go
(Showtime)
As we proceed5 and a half in boys, ass is off the hook
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it, is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time toBetter late than never, but never late is better
They tell me time is money, well, we'll spend it together
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way
We go to dinner, you all don't even look at me to payMature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it, I ain't never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dashYeah, but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra, should we ever need it
