 You know alot of girls be
Thinkin' my songs are about them, butThis is not to get confused
This one's for you
Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done it
You'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever
I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down
Every time I hit her upWhen I get rightI promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it'Til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say you the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best
You the fuckin' best
You the best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
Best I ever had
I say you the fuckin'...
Know you got a roommate
Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat
You know I'll be over there
(Yup!) I'll be over there
Shorty, I'll be over there
I'll be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twiceYou could have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past lifeSweatpants hair tied chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
You ain't bringin' Drake along
You know that I'm workin'
I'll be there as soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waitin' room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assumeAnd until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused wit causeBaby, you my everything
You all I ever wantedWe could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done itYou'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
I want this forever
I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down
Every time I hit her up
When I get right
I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it
'Til she give it upAnd I say the same thing every single time.
I say you the fuckin' best

Sex, love, pain, baby I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the pictureAnd niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for their sister
Magazine, paper girl, but money ain't the issueThey bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me 'the referee' cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend onYeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot
I'm sayin'
Baby, you my everything
You all I ever wanted
We could do it real big
Bigger than you ever done itYou'll be up on everything
Other hoes ain't ever on it
