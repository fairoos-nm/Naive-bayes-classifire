 
Yeah,
Uh, This verse start's as my sniper hits they mark
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let em all go
And most woman are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can't afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stairs
Couple text
Couple dates
Couple I think that we're readys
Couple I think that we should we waits
Are we acting like a couple
I'm just trying to get it straight
Cuz I'm over convinced cuz it's too early for mistakesOhhhh, you had to change up the game
Ohhh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days
Can't stand the rain in July
Oh July
Let the fireworks explode
Exploding
Now it's getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why?
It's just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh Baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
Drake's Verse
Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night
Everynight was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accidentI'm confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so longI was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who kills chivalry
They need to get they sentence in
Meanwhile we arguing and I can't get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest endOhhhh, you had to change up the game
Ohhh, the weather is not the same
Now there's only cloudy days
Can't stand the rain in July
Oh July
Let the fireworks explode
Exploding
Now it's getting colder
Leaves are turning color
Why?
It's just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh Baby oh
Our summer turned into fall
See, it's funny cuz
I never thought this would end
But then the season changedYou are my, You are my, You are my love
Should remain, Should remain, you are my love
I surely did everything to make you happy baby,
Oh yeah
Can't wait for, Can't wait for, Can't wait for springtime
And I will turn into a butterfly,
I will spread my wings and Fly......
And I'm too fly for this shit
Ohhhha wooooh...
