 Waiting on you for so long, too many days since January
I'm still sitting here alone, we should have did this already
Said I got an e-mail today, kinda thought that you forgot about me
But I wanna hit you back to say
Just like you, I get lonely tooBaby, I could really get to know you
Take my time to show you
Don't tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me to another place where I'll be face to face, just you and me
With no rules. Just like you.

Don't wanna come on strong, cause too many people wanna get me
But you know I gotta do, what I gotta do
Just like you, I get lonelyBaby, could really get to know you
