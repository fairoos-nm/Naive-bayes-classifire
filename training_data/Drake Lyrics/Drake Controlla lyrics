When I get, aggressive, tell you to
Go slower, go faster
Like controlla, controlla
Yeah, like controlla, controllaAnd I'm never on a waste ting shorty
I do it how you say you want it
Them girls, they just wanna take my money
They don't want me to give you nothing
They don't want you to have nothing
They don't wanna see me find your lovin'
They don't wanna see me
Smiling back when they preenKnowing I'd lie for you
Thinking I'd die for you

Action speak louder than argument wellBut you can't just diss and come tell me sorry
You can't listen to me talk and go tell my story
