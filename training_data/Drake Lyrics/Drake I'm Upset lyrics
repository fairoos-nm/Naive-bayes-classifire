 Yeah
I'm workin' on dyin'I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way
What you expect?Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month, I'm supposed to pay her bills
And get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991
Outta time, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm coolI'm upset
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double checkYou tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respectGot a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (ayy, ayy)
Every month, she don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front
She gon' tryna settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?I'm upset
Half a million on my head I can't accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a tech (skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked
Hate me, never met me in a flesh
Said she's got somethin's she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the leftGot a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep trynna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
