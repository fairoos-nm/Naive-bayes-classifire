 Michael phelps this for you baby,
Im goin for the gold
my heart is in control,
My mind is on succeed
and i am in the lead
dont buy into the skeems the science or stratege
just giant N U T's
branks tryin in belief, im a lion
on redeem, expired by the green
never tired nor fatigue
never defiant to my team
never lien on the thing until
im lyin on the thing
hooked to wires n things imma die as
a king, if i dont do it now imma try it again
and when i do accomplish it ima try it again
ima riot insane
im a lion my mane hangs down to my strains
and their tied to the game,
I stay dry when it rain im tired of the fame
Got everything to gain and im proud of the pain
the pride and the plain the wise and the strange
denied by the sane beside were the same
whose guidin the train,
whose flyin the plane,
whose drivin the lane,
who dies when it bang,
who fires when it bang,
who lies in the aim,
two lives in the drain,
who cries when they sang,
you hide but you cant
you hide but you aint
i advise you to thank you dont
find what you cant
revive what you tank survive what u paint
supersize what u shrink,
the fries and the drink,
admired as a saint,
defined by my rank,
combined with my strength,
my time and my length,
ima iron out the kinks,
yes im on the brink,
and in the eye ima wink
ima retire in a bank,
yeahhhhhhhhh
and im no quita cuz im a go im a go im a go getta,

victory consistently train all year to be the
enemies misery,
no stress visably neither does it enter me
I think positively,
you cant harm me mentally,
not physically not spiritually
you never get rid of me i am the epitome if this is
what u did to me nothins what u did for me,
nothins what u give to me,
i take whatever im visioning
i break all of the limitings
i shake all of the gimicking the fakery the trickery
nurse how sick is he worst im sickening,
i'll be at the finish line first how quick is he,
ima make sure they mention me for the next century,
ain with the bickering im full of dignity,
im full of energy pull out the inner me
a bull after dinner meat
i stood in the winter heat,
it could be the end of me but good be defendin me,

im allergic to cheatin
and i hate failure and i am in love with
achievement above and beneath it
a hug when i greet it
my eyes on the prize and i love when i seek it
done with the speakin begun with the preachin
I pray until i am one with the deacon
i play until i have won whatever we win
i play until i have won and then i rewin
