Murder Capitol, only key to survive is kill.
If the elements don't murder you,
Tha rydahs will... Fa real.
And niggaz know I go hard to the fullest;
Get involved,
And I got em' playin' dodgeball wit bullets.
(YEA)I got the sawed off, fully

Get fucked--ya play pussy.
(HA)We hit em' up while dey ain't lookin'
And tha body shots hurt But tha head shots took em'
DAMN!
And if tha red dot spot em'
Then tha hollow-head got em'
Knock his tops to his bottom Jack.
(Yea) Ya see we grind from the bottom
Just to make it to da bottom
At the very bottom o' da map
Louisiana--
Piranhas Every where U at.
U gotta wear a extra condom
And a extra gat.
Ya bitch could get it fa actin' like a man
And niggaz in Pak-istan, Impactin' on ya man
I backed his hand... ya man on command
In fronta niggaz he cool
wit dem boyz on fan.
I'm on hot.
I adjust in different climates
Stuck in a animal--Keep runnin wit my prime mates
U ain't did it til U done it like in fives states
Weezy-hustle, No blubber, I put on weight.
And in a drought
I go on a diet and strecth more
Lose all dat weight, leave a nigga wit stretch marks
You'nt even come up to a nigga chest
Pause Up,
PAW, What tha fuck they play dat in da club fa?
Real Shit
I'm duckin' bombs from a drug war
No religion, but da cops swear dat I'ma drug law
Father forgive em' fa dey know not who dey pushin' Lord
Father forgive me if I have to send em' to you Lord
I'm just tryna dodge tha shots dey send to da god
They ridin' up high way to Heaven boulevard.
DAMN!
Dem niggaz pussy and jive--not even in tha eye exam
They ain't lookin fa I.

Now when U smilin' everbody gotta look from tha side.
Cuz when U wilin' U ain't lookin'

And when we hungry, U look like pie
Sweet potato-ass nigga
U lemon Meringue--Apple custard
Cherry jelly--Don't make me get tha biscuit busta (YEA)
What up chizzle?

My speeches can kill
Rest In Peace!(Baby talking)

Lay down laws call me ground law
But don't confuse me wit da law
Naw--but just confuse me wit my paw

Wit tha 40 Cal Rip-kin nigga
Rip a nigga
Flip ya vehicle
Split ya windshield
Whack ya baby mama

And people say that I am a kid still
Cuz tha lil' nigga still ride on big wheels.
U feelin' animal then come on and get killed
This kid peel bandanas like bananas
Say I'm slight bananas

In my Gabana wit my bottom bitch from Savannah
Man a train couldn't stop ya man
