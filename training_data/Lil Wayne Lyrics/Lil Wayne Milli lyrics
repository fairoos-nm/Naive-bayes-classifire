 (A milli, a milli, a milli)I'ma millionaire
I'm a young money millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'ma venereal disease like a menstrual bleedThrew the pencil and leak the sheet of the tablet in my mind
Cuz I don't write shit cuz I ain't got time
Cuz my seconds, minutes, hours go to the all mighty dollar
And the all mighty power of dat chit cha cha chopperSister, Brother, Son, Daughter, Father mothafucker a copper
Got da Maserati dancin' on the bridge pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, ha ha ha ha you can't catch 'em, you can't stop 'em
I go by them goon rules if you can't beat 'em then you prop 'emYou cant man 'em then you mop 'em
You cant stand 'em then you drop 'em
You drop 'em cuz we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher
Motherfucker I'm illA million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derrierre
Like smoke in the thinnest air

Hopin' them crackers see me like, "Look at that bastard Weezy""He's a beast he's a dog, he's a motherfuckin' problem"
Okay you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'

My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flameNow who that wanna do that, boy you knew that chew that swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hourAnd I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sourDon't play in her garden, and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawnmower
Boy I got so many bitches like I'm Mike Lowery
Even Gwen Stefani say she couldn't doubt meMotherfucker I say like face shit without me
Chrome lips pokin' out, the coupe look like it's poutin'
I do what I do and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I will turn a crack rock into a mountain

They don't see me, but they hear me
They don't feel me, but they fear me
