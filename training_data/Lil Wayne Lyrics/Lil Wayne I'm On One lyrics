 Im gettin' son throwed
Iaint went this hard since
I was 18
Apologise if I say,
anythin' I dont mean
Like whats up with your
best friend?
We could all have some fun,
believe me
And whats up whith these
new niggas?
And why they thing it all
comes so easy
But get it while you here boy
Cause all tha hupe dont feel
the same next year boy
Yeah and Ill be right here
in my stop with a little more
cash than I already got
Trippin off you cause you had
you shot.
With my skin tanned and my
hair long
And my fans who been so patient,
me and 40 back to work but we still
smell like a vacation
Hate the rumours, hate your bullshit
Hate these fuckin' allegations,
Im just feelin' like
the throne is for the takin'
Watch me take it!All I care about is money
and the city that Im from
Ima sip until I feel it,
Ima smoke it till its done
And i dont really give a fuck,
and my excuse is that Im young
and Im only gettin' older so
somebody shoulda told ya.
I'm on one
Yeah, fuck it, Im on one
Yeah, I said Im on one
Fuck it, Im on one
Two white cups and
Igot that drink
Could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix
that shit.
Money that we got,
never get that shit
Cause I'm on one
I said fuck it I'm on oneUGH!
Im burnin' purple flowers
Its burnin' my chest
I bury the most cash and burnin' the rest
Walkin' on the clouds,
suspended in thin air
Do ones beneath me recognise
the red bottoms I wear
Burner in the belt
Move the kids to the hills (BOSS)
Bend shawty on the sink,
do it for the thrill
Kiss you on ya neck and tell ya
everythin' is great
Even though I out on bond I
might be facin 8's
Still runnin' with the same
niggas til the death of me
Ever seen a million cash,
gotta count it carefully
Ever made love to the
woman of your dreams
In a room full of money
out in a London as she screams
Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to
make a pair
So yeah, we on one, the feelin'
aint fair (KhÃ¤led)
And its double MG until I get
the chair.All I care about is money
and the city that In from
Ima sip until I feel it,
Ima smoke it till its done
