 Uh, my mind's filled with mine fields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It's Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yea, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin yea
My country tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let em dieGod bless Amerika
This so godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised todayThe end of time is like a hour awayDamn, military minded, lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was looking for me, I'mma hide by abroad
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I'm wired off a socket, but still shockin
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greedMama said take what you want - I took heed yea
My little breed, yea, back to life, back to realityBeen eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shel
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshner
I don't play boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of commands, I'm the missing linkGod bless Amerika
This so godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquetHere we live by the sword and die by the sword
The police are looking for me, I'mma hide by abroad
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I'm wired off a socket, but still shockin em
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
