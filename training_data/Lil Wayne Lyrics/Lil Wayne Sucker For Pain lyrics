 I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for painI wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for painI'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failureDo it for the fam, dog, ten toes down, dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society, all this pressure give me anxietyWalk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulderI torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for painI wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for painI been at it with my homies
it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rolling with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my squadWe just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up take a step back, when we roll up, cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussionI know I been busting, no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what upI torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for painI wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for painI'm devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal
Naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear sh! t but tomorrowAnd I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nothing but pain
You just fvcking complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fvck with Lil Wayne
I'mma jump from a plane or stand in front of a trainCause I'm a sucker for pain
Used to doing bad, now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we started and finished itNo pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young ageNo emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnessesI torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for painMore pain
got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
for more pain
got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
for more pain
got me begging, begging, begging, begging, begging, begging
for more pain
