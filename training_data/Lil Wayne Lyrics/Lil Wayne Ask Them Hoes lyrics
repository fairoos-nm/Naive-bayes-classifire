Call me weezy f. bitch im straight
From the street the dope game is sour
And the dope is sweet i live in the tower
Got a scope on the heat
Hit you from 100 feet
We dont even have to meet
Ya bitch love me we dont even have to meet
But if i run into her believe me i will (hold on)...
Ya bitch love me we dont even have to meet
But if i run into her believe me i will do her
And if that bitch bitch is crazy
Believe me i will sue her
Got some hungry ass lawyers
That would eat her up and chew her
I dont know why you love her
I wish i never knew her
She only give me brain
She was just another tutor
She blow my whole band
I was just another tuba
Now get off my dick
And get lost in aruba

Young money over bitches
