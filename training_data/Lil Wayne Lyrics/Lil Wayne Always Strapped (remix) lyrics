 I'm always strapped when I hit the club
Niggaz give me daps, bitches give me hugs
And since I'm paid
Niggaz be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
Niggaz be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
YezziirrCheck me out, look
26 inches, bitch I'm sittin' crooked
Old school Chevy, faster than the silver bullet
Strawberry paint, seats vanilla puddin'
2 bitches, gon' and eat each other's pussyTop chopped sent da car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unorthodox, I got your bitch
Ridin' my dick wit no shocks
(Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce)I'm the hottest shit jumping out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup and I can make a soda popKeep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggaz wit me ridin' till the motor stop
I got these hoes straight livin' out the soap op
I got a couple like a coke top

Niggaz give me daps, bitches give me hugs

Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em backYeah shorty, the last MOB
Flying in the Bugati with a coolin' on the seat
Put the K in the car while we ridin' blazed
Put the chopper on the pussy in the driveway
Bet the house on the youngen 'n' we got paid
Triple colors on the bikes 'n' the new MercedesBustin' keys on they ass while we got paid
But my tens ridin' hot to an open bay
Uptown made man out the hard way
Crap in the bucket 50 shots bitch make a way
I thought they knew shorty
Like father like sonBall till' ya fall stuntin' with them paper plates
Throwin' hundreds on them hoes while we eatin' stakes
We in the club poppin' bottles like 'erday
We grind for the shine nigga gettin' big moneyGot a fleet tossin' chicken nigga get cake
I'm on his island with this power like Scarface
I'm in the Impala dropped top chawwnky
Ice man, Birdman, rockin' red monkeys
All ready nigga, neighborhood superstars
All we gon' ball till we fall bitchAlways strapped when I hit the club
Niggaz give me daps, bitches give me hugs

Niggaz be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back
