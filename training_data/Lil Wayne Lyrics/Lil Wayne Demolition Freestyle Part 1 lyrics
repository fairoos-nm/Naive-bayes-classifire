 And I don't wanna talk about it
Gangsta shit right in front you nigga walk around it
Nigga let me do me
They know I kick it like Jet Lee Bruce lee
And Ive done what they cant do me ill put my gun up to your Aunt Suzie
And blow out a dubie paint her rubie I am a looney you niggas puny
I puke on the beat I juke and never fumble
Man I spit that dope like I swallowed a bundle
Gotta spit that dope up cause the old heads said if you don't it'll bust
Heard if I sell it hard it'll rush but if them people come if its soft it'll flush
Certainly don't get caught in the blind and keep yo curtain straight
No I don't drink wine but I smoke purple grape sometimes see purple stars
And I ain't talking about purple bapes
I gets paid early cause I be workin late too many pain for memories shit hurt to say
Crack flow no bake just stir and shake shootin' when we pull up like erkle waste
Sip syrup got me movin' at a turtle pace but quick draw pop out like a turtle face
Paid in full you cant murk the ace I kill the beat and beat the murder case
That's right I'ma kill this shit and if the glove don't fit I'ma need a catchers mitt
Cause I'm high like a pitch yeah I'm high like a pitch like Mariah and shit
I guess I'm higher than a bitch
keep it dirty like I'm lion in the ditch
Like Eli I'm from new Orleans I'm a giant in this bitch move the G and add an S and put the I before the N and put the A in front of that and that is what I am to the end
That's a Saint muthafucka simplify it for them where your funeral comes with a 2nd line at the end yeah
But you wont be second linin' with them cause you be in the hearse that's behind all of them
I see your homies dressed in black like they finna ride but that fashion statement is tellin' a lie
I'm pelican fly Mac 11 inside my bullets come with wings and your cerebellum can fly fuckin' right oh yeah
Young Money we are sick as Gonorrhea like nausea heart burn indigestion upset stomach and diarrhea get some Pepto Bismol hoe!
