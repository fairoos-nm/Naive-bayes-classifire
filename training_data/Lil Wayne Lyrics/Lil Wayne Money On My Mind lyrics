Building gone, these niggas ain't loyal they snitches shitsSince Nuski passed I got to get shit, empty shit, thinking bro I got to get rich
Catch the killer I'mma sip for him, like the lord just sinned for him
Like I'm the maker, slang caine like the Undertaker
Ops like getting confiscated, I'm just turnin' up on the block on haters
Tell them that I made itQuavo!
Young nigga bout my money, act a fool, this the lifestyle that I had to chooseWaking up at 9, kick 5 doors at a time, you can walk in the mall with designer shoes

Meanwhile I'm over here in a foreign country, nigga wanna know who done itYou gotta survive, the jungle safari, I'm a legend alive
You got no rings like Amar'e, pull out the chopper I'm sorry
Do you remember the days I was down, I couldn't afford it

Entrepreneur independent did it on my own, yeah it was I
Pistol Pete, my nigga Dada

The streets is a jungle he didn't survive
Guala, peso, euro make a movie call me Robert Dinero
Wrestler flexing Eddie Guerrero go to the riches the streets is narrow
Right now, you can get it right now, I run to the money dont need a tie
I'm watching my back like I am a owl, 30 round extension
Laugh at you niggas like Richard Pryor, minimum wage I make 40 thou'
You trusting that bitch she won't' hold you down
Smoking on loud, that's surround sound
There's a knock at the door I look at the peep hole
I leave you with stiches so where is Lilo?
Pay me my money before it get repoed
All the dirt that I did, And the lord he still choseNigga I'll a tweak 'bout my money
