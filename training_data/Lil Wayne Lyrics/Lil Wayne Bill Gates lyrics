If them niggas keep trippin' they can share an ambulance
Throw up blood with my hands, my gang poppin' niggas

All day I do it, I do it like Tony
Got a sign on my dick that say "bad bitches only"
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt

Got a silence on the gun, that bitch go "pew"
Got-got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too

Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the vomit faceAnd still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
