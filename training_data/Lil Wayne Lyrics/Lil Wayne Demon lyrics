 Sleeping with the enemy, my demons are too intimate
She's sleeping very gently so now they're starting to enter it
And now they're starting to mentor me, geekin' like Brittany
Tweaking my energy,
Eat and die sympathy
Scream and cry, Infamy
Come alive mentally, and love, die physically
My love cry miserably
Hugs getting looser, her tongue tied kissing me
She fucked thy niggas see now they both igging me
But demons got dignity
Demons got memories, I had a lil' revenge in me
So now I'm at synthesizing, 'bout to stop giggling
And dinner start sizzlingA demon with demands, a demon with demands
A demon with demands, a demon with demandsShe agree to my demand too
Brought the demon out her ass too
I'm a demon not the man, youA Demon with demands, a Demon with demands
I'm a Demon with demands, I got demons on demand, yeah yeah yeah
I'm a demon not the man, you, bought the demon out the man, ooh
Bought the demon out the man, ooh
The demon out the man
Bought the demon out the man, oohYou done pulled the demon out the man
Pulled the demon out the pants
Put the demon in your mouth
Then pulled it clean up out your ass
Took her demon by the hands
Asked the demon can we dance
Found a halo in her trash but she don't talk about her pastA demon with demands, a demon with demands
