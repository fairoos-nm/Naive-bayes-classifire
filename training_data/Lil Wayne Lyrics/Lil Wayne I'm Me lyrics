To the House Of Pain
Now I'm stuck here to deal
With the house's pain
Fuck with me
I will peel like the house's paint
Let's go
Niggas don't wanna see me
'Cause I'm better in bold
The only time I will depend
Is when I'm 70 years old
That's when I can't hold my shit within
So I shit on myself
'Cause I'm so sick and tired
Of shitting on everybody else
I try to tell you like I'm sayin' somethin'
I'm from the Dirty like the bottom of my pants cuff
And now nothing gonna stop me
So just envy it
Hey, I'll accept a friendly quit, haha
Yea I'm me, I'm me, bitch I'm me
