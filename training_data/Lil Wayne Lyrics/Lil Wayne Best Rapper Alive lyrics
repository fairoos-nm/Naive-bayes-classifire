 Bring the crowd and I'm loud In living colour
It is Weezy Fuckin' Baby got these rappers in my stomach
Yummy, I'm takin' it I ain't asking them for nothing
If you sell a million records we can battle for ya money
I rather count a hundred thousand dollars on a sunday
Watch a football game and bet it all on one play
Still stuntin' baby yes I'm still flossin'
Latest car on the market with the top peeled off it
Big wheels make it look a lil bulky
You look a lil salty have ya' self a chill coffee
Chill out the guns is still out
Even though I am a boss I got papers to fill out
I'm busy I got paper to reel in
God I hope they steppin' at the end of my rod
And I hope I'm fishing in the right pond
And I hope you catchin' on to every line
Who am I?The best rapper alive (huh? yep)

And you should be afraid, be very afraidThe heart of New Orleans
Thumpin' and beatin'
Livin' and breathin'
Stealin' and feedin'
Peelin' and leavin'
Killin' and grievin'
Dearly departed erased deleted
No prints, no plates, no face, no trace
Out of sight out of mind
No court no case
Sell his chain celebrate block party second line
Zulu ball essence fest jazz fest mardi gras
Shorty bounce body rock
Now he drop now he got
Family cry tell the feds tell the cops
Smell the rat comin' back to the house
To the spot tap tap knock knock who is that
(Pow!) trigga man, hoodie man tell the kids
Boogie man, pistol pete, ammo mammal, gun man, blum blam!

Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em good, fuck 'em long, fuck 'em hard
Fuck who? Fuck 'em all
(Yeah) like that just like that right back
I'm on that money train and the mac'll knock 'em off track
The quarterback well protected from the Warren Sapp
The young heart attack I spit that cardiac
You can't see me baby boy you got that catoract
I'm right here straight out the hood just like an alley cat
Since everyone's a king where the fuck your palace at
Me I got callus on my hand I can handle that
It's no problem baby I so got 'em
It's just a victory lap baby I'm just joggin'
And I ain't even out of breathe
The motherfuckin' best yet sorry for cursing
