 1: Lil Wayne]
Um, like a man
I got all this money, all these bitches, like a man
I don't want the glamour nor the glitz, and like a man;
I got all these goons, all these guns, all this land, all these cars, all these boobs, all these tongues, like a man
I got all these foods, all this fun, all these pools, all these tubs, all these moods, all these drugs, all these rooms, all these rugs
The rules ain't for us, we just do's what we does
From the moon to the sun, like a man
Make her pop that pussy like a Xan
I was sittin' in that cell like a pan
Did it like a man, did it like a motherfuckin' man
I just come from visitation, I snuck up a couple grams, hoe
I be fuckin' with them champs, hoe
I be skatin', I be jumpin' off them ramps, hoe
I be racing, I be dustin' all them Lambos
I'ma hit you, I'ma hit you with that wham, hoe
Oh, oh man, hands in her pants but she got a old man
She snort a dab of coke, we don't dab
We gettin' money like the fuckin' Arabs
The weed musty like the fuckin' Arabs
Codeine in her punch, that's a straight jab
Slime like a man, I call her ass a cab
If her ass ain't got no ass to grabLike a man (Heh)
Like a man (Heh)
Like a man, like a man, like a motherfuckin'
Like a man, like a man, like a motherfuckin'
Like a manI got all these hoes, all these woes, like a man
I rock all these shows 'round the globe, like a man
I ride for all my bros, that's who drove
All my haters play your role, Gladiator, Russell Crowe
Elevator on your floor
Hot potato on the nose of the handgun
Aiming at your dandruff, cocaine in my pants cuff
Dodging handcuffs like a ram truck
Coupe on the rims like a slam dunk
She gon' catch a nut, fuck niggas catch tantrums
Boy, we went from stretch Hummers to the stretch mansions
'Rari all pink like 'fuck breast cancer!'
Nigga, we done made trap houses out the Hamptons
Like a man
Lil Tunechi off the wall, like Spider-Man
Promethazine, cream soda, and the Vicodin
Like a man, I've been hard since a diaper then
And ever since I been on Mars, I've been buyin' land
Like a man, like a gangster, like a real one
These pussies get the dildo, I get the deal done
Like a man, I hate a bitch with a lil' tongue
And all this fuckin' old money make me feel youngYeah, like a man, like a motherfuckin' man
Like a man, like a, like a motherfuckin' man
Like a, like a motherfuckin' man
She gon' fuck me like a, like I'm her motherfuckin' manBut the bitch got a man
Oh, put that nigga in the can
Uh, but she wish I was her man and I wish she would stop playin'
And that nigga is a fan
Like a man tho, that nigga is a fan tho
You need a challenge to expand, hoe
Really, you can do better, I'm just sayin' tho
Uh, I'm just sayin' tho
Me and you can make Magic like Orlando
You naked in my bando, on my piano
I put it in your asshole, you go SopranoLike a man, we some motherfuckin' assholes
Make her back that ass up and then I backstroke
I'm screamin' money, cash, hoes, money, cash, hoes
These lil' niggas washed up, they need some bathrobes
We the niggas, I'll stop if we in smash mode
These lil' niggas washed up I'm on my last load
We just take the guns up and press fast forward
Got them bricks, like I'm shootin' it from half court
Leave a nigga brains all over the dashboard
Leave a nigga brains all over the dance floor
We in private planes, all in different airports
I'm about to treat a pussy like a crash course
I'm so fly, I feel like I'm with the air force
I can't lie, I don't like her if her hair's short
Like a man, like a motherfuckin' man, no
Young Money squad up and I'm the man, hoe
Tunechi
