 [Lil Whyte]
Go on and slip me two Xanax bars, I'm ready to get fool
5th o' crown to wash it down, I'm downtown snappin' rolls
Ain't no shame up in my game, in fact I'm mentally deranged
Oxycontin in my system, man I'm feelin' kinda strange
Watch me choke about this dope, blueberry from Texas
You wanna get up in rotation that's too bad 'cause I'm stressin'
Right now it's 1:30 a.m., 11 Percocets just entered me
15 min from this second I'll be crawlin' on my knees
Laughin' at the crowd of all the clowns that be surroundin' me
Take another Lortab to calm me down and let me see
Body be relaxed, muscles be loose and you have stopped the pain
No more bitchin' 'bout your day at work and drivin' in the rain
Put up with the fussin' and discussion I plant in yo brain
Hypnotizin' minds like all the rest but I come through the vein
Take a chill pill and slow me down to get back in the game
Gotta be up on yo P's and Q's to even feel it mane[Chorus X2]
Oxycontin, Xanax bars, Percocets, and Lortabs
Valiums, Morhpine Patches, Ecstasy, and it's all up for grab
Whatcha want, whatcha need, hit me up I gotcha mane
whatcha want, whatcha need, hit me up I gotcha mane[Lord Imfamous]
Scarecrow, Scarecrow what's that ya poppin'?
A powerful pill they call Oxycontin
But it'so tiny, yeah it got you draggin'
Haven't you heard big things come in small packages
I prefer the orange ones with the black OC
Take two and you cannot move from outcha seat
Some people melt 'em down in a needle and shoot 'em up
But I pop 'em with Seroquel like glue, I am stuck[Crunchy Blac]
See I'ma pill popper, so I'ma keep poppin' em
Gimme 20 Xanax and I'ma start droppin' em
They ain't no stoppin' him, when they in my system
Mane I really miss 'em, can you help me get 'em
I heard you have Clidina, on that fuckin' pill shed
Gimme some fuckn Ec' - gimme some Percocets
I need me some four bar, so I can break down
'Cause a nigga like me 'finna take it to funky town[Chorus X2]
Oxycontin, Xanax Bars, Percocets and Lortabs
Valiums, Morphine Patches, Ecstacy and it's all up for grab
Whatcha want, what'cha need, hit me up I gotcha mane
Whatcha want, what'cha need, hit me up I gotcha mane
