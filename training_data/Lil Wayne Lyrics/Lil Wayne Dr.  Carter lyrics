 Good morning Doctor Carter (Hey sweetie)
Looks like its going to be a long day (Ahh another one what we got?)
Your first patient (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concept (Uh-Huh)
Originality (Ugh)
His flow is weak (Another one)
And he has no style (Ugh)
Whatcha got for um?Ok, let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on
Dr. Carter to the rescue, excuse me if I'm late
But like a thief it takes time to be this great
Ha! so just wait, your style is a disgrace
Your rhymes are fifth place and I'm just grace
One, uno, ace and I'm trying to make your heart beat like bass
But your sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break, where is your originality
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery
Capture what I say, all I need is one mic, all I need is one take
Like hey, brighter then the suns rays got a pistols on the playground
Watch the gunplay like no kidding, no kids in the way
But the kids do watch, gotta watch what we say, gotta work everyday
Gotta not be Cliche
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensai
You gotta have faith you gotta, gotta wait, wait
I think I, think I lost someoneDial 118, please
Good afternoon Dr. Carter (Nurse)
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lacks respect for the game
(Uhhhh... let me see...)You think you can save him?Okay
Respect is in the heart
So that's where I'mma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it
Now hey kids
Plural, I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling
Or rereciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it
Some say its biting
But I say its enlightening
Besides Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'mma doctor they don't understand my writing
So I stop writing
Now I'm like lighting
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titans
Fast and exciting
My passion is frighting
Now let me put some more Vocab in your I.V.
Here take this Vicatin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget so pay me no mineI don't walk like I talk it cause I'm runningI don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency un-it
I've done it, I've lost another one...Good Evening Dr. Carter, it's been a long dayBut this one looks much better than the others
His respect is back up, concepts sound goodHis style has shown strong sign of improvement
All he needs now, is his swagger
(Ok, let me take the gloves off then)Swagger tighter then a yeast infection
Fly go hard like geese erection
Fashion patrol police detection
I stay tight like Chinese connection
I stay tight like pussy at night
Baby don't get me wrong I could do that pussy right
But I'm to wrong to right
To fresh to fight
To paid to freestyle
To paid to freestyle
I had to say it twice
Swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast I rap slow
Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flow sweeter then honey oats
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow
His blood starting to flowHis lungs starting to grow
This one starting to show
Strong signs of lifeWhere's the stitches, here's the knife
Smack his face, his eyes open
I reply with a nice welcome back
Hip Hop I saved your lifeHe looks good, his vitals are up
He's looking good, he's looking good, I think we got one
Dr. Carter, I think we got one
Yep, yeah, we got one
We saved him, he's good
He's good, we got one, he's good
He's good, we got him, we saved him, he's a go, he's good
