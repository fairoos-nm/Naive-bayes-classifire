You screamed Suu-Whoop
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You bought a Bugatti, so you can flex
Most of the bad bitches your exTattoos, Suu-Whoop, Bugatti, Nobu
New subject, new paper, new Class, new school
New buddies, new haters, new ass, new boobs
Smash later, too soon, too bad, too cool
Too hot, too lit, too high to move
Two eyes to view, but too blind to bloom
Who lied to you?Two middle fingers that's up high to whom
It may consume, kaboom, goddamn
Who knew that I am the guru with voodoo
That sued you to high hell
With shooters that shoot through the
iron man and see through the con man
And now he a dyin' man
I turned a goddamn into a God's Plan
Go over to diagram and get to the job man
Watch for the spycam
Sit back and watch and do not watch your watch hand

They might think they've got a pretty good jump shot,

But our kids can't all aspire to be LeBron or Lil Wayne!
