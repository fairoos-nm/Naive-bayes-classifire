 With everything happening today
You dont know whether you're coming or going
But you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror dont blow it
Look at me when Im talkin to you
You looking at me but I'm lookin through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I dont see nobody else
I see myself I'm looking at theMirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I amSo why are we here talkin' to each other againUh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
but I'm with you when you re all alone
And you correct me when Im lookin wrong
I see that guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window painI see the scars that remain
I see you Wayne, Im lookin at the.Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fallYou've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other againLookin at me now I can see my past
Damn I look just like my f-ckin dad
Light it up, thats smokin' mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirrorI see my momma smile thats a blessin
I see the change, I see the message
and no message could been any clearer
So I'm stared with the man in the...Mirror on the wall (MJ taught me that)
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend (Take em to Mars, man)
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we talkin' to each other again
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend
You told me that they can understand the man I am
So why are we here talkin' to each other again
Mirror on the wall...
(Hey B.P., looks like I did take em to Mars this time)
So why are we talkin to each other again
