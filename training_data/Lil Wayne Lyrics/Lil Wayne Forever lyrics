 It may not mean nothing to ya'll
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever manLast name ever, first name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy I ain't nothing to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
And your city faded off to brown, nino
She insists she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money come and find me, nemo
If I was at the club you know I ball (Bald), chemo
Drop the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like malcom
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witnessIt may not mean nothing to ya'll
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever manHey, ever ever Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Ya'll seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gon' build statues for me
Old money benjamin button, what nothin'
Now superbad chicks giving me MacLovin'
You would think I ran the world like Michelles husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class mueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom would turn you to a maniac
All the way in hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and god damn they snap
I used to want this thing Forever ya'll can have it backIt may not mean nothing to ya'll
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever manOkay, hello it's the martian, space jam jordans
I want this shit Forever, wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shhhh, my foots sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as lastIt may not mean nothing to ya'll
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever manThere they go, back in stadiums as shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, macademia they go so ballistic whoa
He can make them look like posers, he's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had of a buzz like this since the last time that he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for pinnochio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes and establishing a name as he goes
The passion of the flame is ignited, you can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck that I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villians, whose stayin' inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings, until our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths now rewind it
Payback motherfucker for the way that you doubted me hows it taste
When I slap the taste out of your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecters so just incase your thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save by the time I'm through with this place so DrakeIt may not mean nothing to ya'll
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever man
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit Forever man, ever man, ever man
