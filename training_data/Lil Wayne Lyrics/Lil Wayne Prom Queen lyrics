 Yeah!I loved her fancy underwear
I'd sit behind her every year
Waiting for the chance to get
To tell her I'm the one she should be with, oh
She's popular with all the guys
So innocent in my eye
I could see her in my life
She would've had the world if she were mine
But, see she had other plans, I couldn't understand
Her and her stupid friends, varsity's biggest fans
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it allShe had it all figured out
But she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is crying, sitting outside of my door
See, you never know how
How everything could turn aroundUhhhh, they loved her fancy underwear
Every boyfriend, every year
She tried to keep 'em entertained
When they can hardly remember her name uahh
She did everything she could
Just to make them laugh and treat her good
She'd find herself alone
Asking herself where did she go wrong-wrong-wrong
She didn't realize she chased the type of guys
That don't believe in ties, trying to apologize
Never forget the day she laughed and walked away
And I couldn't stop her, I guess she had it allShe had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is crying, sitting outside of my door
See, you never know how
How everything could turn aroundYeahh, yeahhh
Oo, uh, uh
WoooShe had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
'Cause she didn't think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is crying, sitting outside of my door
See, you never know how
How everything can turn around
Oooo
