The Best Rapper... alive
HIT ME
Good Mornin New York
Good Afternoon New Orleans
Good Night AmericaYea, Dough is what I got, Lil Mama
Dough is what I got, bird lady
Dough is what I got, shorty
Dough is what I got, baby
C'mon I'm Paid, I'm Paid, I'm Paid, I'm PaidHey, Give a woman none,
nuh-uh I already gave my brother some,
It's my sister turn
Ain't it funny how the fish do burn
Wit ya boy just relax like a fresh new perm
And the world in the barrel of the pistol turn
Boy we get it how we live, never live and learn
Gotta talk about the flow cuz you is concerned
Only down-south rapper coulda been in The Firm
Or.The Commission or a Wu-Tang nigga
Tryna tell you I could kick it like Lu Kang nigga
Got that Subzero flow, how you want me ma?
Make her "Get Over Here" like Scor-pi-on
And, when it comes down to this recordin
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan
No, I won rings for my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same Coach, Same Game, Been Startin
Same Triangle Offense
I come through the lane like a-dodgin
Referee niggas is lame they call chargin
I have no brain I'm retarted
We are not the same, I'm a Martian
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am Magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or late September whatever you call it
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage
I ain't talkin to no particular audience
But understand I'm the guardian
And understand there won't be no guardin him
You would just get played like an accordion
I don't give a damn if she's Bossy
I keep pussy runnin like a faucet
She better catch like she's Steve Largent
Because I'm "Wussupppp" like MartinSee, I know y'all talkin bout me...
And... y-y-y-you don't like what you hear sometimes, but
Since I'm so bright I'ma put the spotlight on you babyShow me what you pop Lil Daddy
I know you need to stop, stop hatin
I know what you're not, who dey?
And that is Weezy Baby
Blunts up, Now Blaze, Blaze, BlazeI'm WorkinTell the World Take 6
Young Dictionary make words make sense
Then, I make cents make dollas,
Make the skinny girl holla,
Make the fat girl hungry,
Make the ugly girls want me,
But the pretty girls on me,
Make the shy girls horny,
Make the fly girls corny,
And only for me,
Because of who I A-M holla back in the morning.
Hey, now holla back if you own shit
The CEO of the moment
Bullshit, I don't condone it
Aww baby, just hop on itYa like dat
I knowww
