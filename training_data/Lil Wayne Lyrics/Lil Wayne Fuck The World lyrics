 Look, look, lookA young nigga screamin' fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin' rie
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seatI'm tryna' stay under intoxication
'Cause I lost my father and got a daughter, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin' liquor like it's water, gettin' pissy drunk
And stayin' away from them lil' broads that tryin' to give me someI keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my waste line
Duckin' the law, 'cause I ain't tryna' do no fed time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of everything and keep macita straightSo I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin'
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin' that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream "Fuck the world, man, I'm too young for this"Look, I don't curse but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin' for my mother and I'm payin' billsLook, I don't curse but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin for my mother and I'm payin' billsGive me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The FED's said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha Brizzah
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'emAnd teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin' talkin' 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child supportAnd my own family deny me of what I do, 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff
Plus, my niggas keep fallin' to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin' away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin' they self everydayWe keep fightin' but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuckLook, I don't curse but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin for my mother and I'm payin' billsI mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me, 'cause I'm a young thugDear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin' like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and CMRI try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveillance when and wherever
Wreckin' they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddarI tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song
Fuck the worldLook, I don't curse but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin for my mother and I'm payin' billsLook, I don't curse but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin for my mother and I'm payin' billsLook, I don't curse but in this verse man, fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin for my mother and I'm payin' bills
