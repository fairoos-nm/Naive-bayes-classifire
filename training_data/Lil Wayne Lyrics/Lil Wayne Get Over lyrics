 Yeah, yeah, real rap, real rap, real rap fo ya, yeah
Lighters up, lets get 'emThooouugh, though I'm missin' you (straight to the head man)
I'll find a way to get through
I know livin' without ya is impossible (yeah)
Gooonnee... I know you gon' live on (cry momma, cry momma)
Cus you were my brother and I love ya, and I miss ya, ooohhhhStay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya
He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor
Standin' on stage in front of thousands
Don't amount to me not having my father
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard
I'm alright God, shit I'm still breathin'
But lose hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin'
Throw me down some comfort, cause my heart need it
Tryin' to cope wit my chances and meet 'em
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin' to take it easy
Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my niggaThooouugh, though I'm missin' you
(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over
but I'm a soldier, so I gotta over, can't stay sober, 
I'm just tryin to get over)

Gooonnee... I know you gon' live on

Cus you were my brother and I love ya, and I miss ya, oohhhhSmoke Kush all day and pop painkillers
Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us
This what the streets showed us
This how the block made us, the same block where they layed 'em
I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me
Lord will I be next for the taking? Take me
I know I'm livin' like I know when I'm comin'
But I'm just livin' cause I know that it's comin'
And the end is comin', but I ain't runnin'
I and hidin' and duckin', I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it
I'm just speakin' from the heart of the diein' public
We still beatin', we gon' rise above it
Though it seem like they cheatin' and we loosin'
We survive if nothin', they could never take the stride from strugglin'
I gotta ride
And sometimes that ride get bloody
But I just think about my buddy and go after that money, but uhh...Ohhh, we gotta get over, we gotta get over, gotta get over
It's almost over, and we gon' be alright
(I gotta get over, I gotta get over, cause bitch I'm a soldier)Straight Patron out the bottle to the head now
We getting read now, bitch my nigga dead now
And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now
I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds
Now I gotta walk around, brim down
Just tryin' to find my way to the next day, escape
Ya birthday could be ya death date
So I'm livin' like it was just yesterday, let's pray
Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together
It's murder murder, I don't think it get better
So be a competitor or get out the weather
Me? I got a umbrella and a berretta
I'm just tryin' to make sure my daughter future progressin'
And behind that, I'm shootin' excessive, trust me
The beautiful dead, we livin' with the ugly
I just tell my pops wait for me, I'm comin'Thooouugh, though I'm missin' you
(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over
but I'm a soldier, so I gotta over, can't stay sober, 
I'm just tryin to get over)
I'll find a way to get through
I know livin' without ya is impossible
Gooonnee... I know you gon' live on
(I miss my dawg I can't believe that it's over
but I'm a soldier, so I gotta over, can't stay sober, 
I'm just tryin to get over)
Cus you were my brother and I love ya, and I miss ya, ooohhhhhhThey ask me why I wear shades at nighttime... 
cause I don't wanna see nothin'! yeah...
Like I said, life ain't nothin' 
but a long extended road, keep drivin'
I done passed up plenty people up on the side of road, no help, keep goin'
Yeah... lost a lot of passengers on the ride, kept goin'... yep...
Who knows when I'll run outta gas, yeah...
