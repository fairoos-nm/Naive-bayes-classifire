 We are at war
With the universe
The sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns downYeah, some say tragedy is hard to get over
But some time that tragedy means its over, soldier
From the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My shoulders are strong, I prove them wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on, let the truth be known
But they talk that freedom at us and didn't even leave a ladder, damnI work at the corner store
We all got problems problems
No one's gon' fight alone
No one's gon' save us now
How you feel? you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome noYou tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna beI, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fates not around, the lucks all gone
Don't ask me whats wrong, ask me whats right
And I'mma tell you what's life?
And did you know?
I lost everything, but I ain't the only one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one, and don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They try to tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city under water, some people still floating
And they wonder why black people still voting, 
cause your president's still choking
Take away the Football team, the Basketball team
Now all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart, and a wish and a prayer
Lets prayThese friends they come and go
But I got family family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
But there's no where to go,
But there's future future
Don't make this seem so low
And we can't overcomeYou tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna beAnd if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe baby, Gods got a blessing to spare
Yes, I know the process has so much stress
But its the progress that feels the best
Cause I came from the projects straight to success
And your next, so try they cant steal your pride its inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining
I know...
Yeah, yeah... yeah
See... right now we just riding on love
And shine in the dark, we ain't tryna do nothing be at the heart
We need love, that's all nowYou tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna be
You tie my hands
What am I gonna be
What have I done so bad
What is my destiny
You tie my hands
What am I supposed to see
What have I done so bad
What am I gonna beBorn right here in the USA
But due to tragedy, looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So, accept my emotion, do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul
And I must be me
We got spirit y'all
We go spirit
We got soul y'all
We got soul
They don't want us to see, but we already know
