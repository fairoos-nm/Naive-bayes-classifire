 Dipset Pt. 2
Kush, good kush
Weezy, dip dip
Wayne, set set
And I grip techs, leave em waterbed wet
And I know just where to put these hollowtips
His chest, his chest, his chestAiyo I take on a gang a gangs, anythang
Animals oragitangs
Gorillas turn to Bathing Apes when I make it rain
I got a whole collection
I got a dope connection
I got a coke connection
I got a dope infection
No homo, my flow is hard as an erection
So that's why its fuck the world wit protection
Pay attention to the lecture
My words carry life like a stretcher
Yeah, you know young wayne in here
Smellin team spirit, like kurt cobain was here
Yeah, yeah we got them thangs in here
And we will bang in here
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And the bank is here
Lincoln's here, Grants is here
Jackson's here, Franklin's here
Them dead mufuckas
And the drank is here, dank is here
Stank in here, gangstas here
Wankstas feel, that red mufucka
And my city hot, ride wit the itchy cock
Coupe wit the titties popped
Where the fuckin city cop
And I got the haters like, "When will he stop?"
Maybe a minute after never, set ya clocks
I'm a nutcase, uptown's my birthplace
They feel me comin like the weekend on thursday
We got Vegas chips, nigga bet bet
I hope you boys ready, because I'm jet set
And when I come up in the building you already know
Bitch wet, bitch wet, bitch wet, fuck nowYes, um, gloves, drawls, socks, tees
All made by Ralph Laureen
No shades just, my eyeballs watchin em
Tattoos on top of them, igloos for watches
And champagne for breakfast, and
Sports cars for lunch, and pussy for dinner
I eat rappers and call it pussy for dinner
Ask the paparazzi, I'm in the mazeratti
Ridin shotti, bad bitch, clyde and bonnie
I call her Kammie, that's short for kamikaze
She called me daddy and never short wit daddy money
Its Weezy Baby, shine like a brass monkey
I'm never broke, never have a cast on me
Always paid, always got cash on me
I gotta feed, the pockets in my pants hungry
I'm a phantom hauler, a shooter not a brawler
And ya girlfriends a determined Carter caller
Control a bitch, and let a nigga hold a bitch
Put her on the corner shit, and let her make a porno flick
She would play the roll again
Whenever she roll again, pop a pill and roll again
Now we on the roll again
I work her, work her
Tell her be my slave, bitch I'm paid
Out my cage, I just can't feel my face
With Santana, we wild riders like Al Queda
Supreme dada, young mula, Bird Junior, yeah
