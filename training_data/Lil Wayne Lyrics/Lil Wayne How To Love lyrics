 Cut the music up
A lil' louder
YeahYou had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to loveYou had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in the corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had loveWhen you was just a young'un, your looks were so precious
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you're sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulderSee you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to loveSee you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to loveFor a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a loveOoohh, you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and strippin'
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crookYou see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to loveSee you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to loveOoohh, see I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeahh
And I want you to know
You're far from the usual
Far from the usualYou see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
Yeahh, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
