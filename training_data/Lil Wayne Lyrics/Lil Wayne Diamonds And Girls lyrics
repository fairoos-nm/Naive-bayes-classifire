Di-Diamonds and[Verse 1:]
Get em
Ugh
Like 5, 6 chains on him
Slick Rick, no patch just frames on him
Marc Jacobs Aviators and a V-Neck
10 bitches, 10 pistols on the P jet
And a drop top Madena with the top up
I'm in that bitch getting net like a shotput
100, 000 for the grill, if I lie I die
Flow sick so sick see the cianide
And heres my most funniest joke, I'm broke (haha)
Don't worry 'bout me, the money got me
And I keep the burner on me like an I.D.
The Lamborghini orange like vitamin C
And leave a bitch stuck like a kite in a tree
Weezy F. B., the money is the matter
I'm working like a bad bladder, M.O.B.[Chorus]

Di-Diamonds and[Verse 2 - Currency:]
Yeah
Hailing from the bottom of the map
But standing at the top of the game
Kush got a nigga looking like I could really use a nap
But I'm still out wildin' with the gang
Got diamonds in my chain
More colors than the Northern Lights
Life is a traffic jam but I'm on a motor bike
Zig-zagging past these bastards, laughing at them
I got them suicidal like the doors on the Phantom
Yeah, hot spitter nigga, who you thought it was
Bitches want to hold me in the morning like a coffee mug
I don't try to lock them down cause I'm not an officer
I just knock them down in groups of ten
As if I'm in the lane aiming for bowling pins
Then the style switch so quick
Have you thinking that the disc skipped
Pimping serious
Make them bring it back like pass interferance[Chorus]

Di-Diamonds and[Verse 3: - Lil Wayne]
Speed boat, white Beater
Balling like Derek Jeter for every reason
That Testaroaster can get ghost like it never seen ya
The same color as Sesame-a, Diarheam, The pioneer-a
I am here-a, right here-a
The watch nasty like gonnorhea
Money long like Nia
I appear-a via sattelite
Whomever don't like the premier-a, he a hermaphrodite
Vegetaters up in my ear-a, get it clear
Pretty women want this nigga right here-a like Richard Gear
I switch the gear-a
And stear and disappear
And if I ever jump off a pier I would probably fly[Chorus]
