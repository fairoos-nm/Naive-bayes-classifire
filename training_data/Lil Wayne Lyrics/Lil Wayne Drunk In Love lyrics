 I woke up in that p*ssy and starting stroking
You woke up and said "Go baby"
She said "f*ck me hard, don't take it easy on me
Don't do me no favors"
No neighbors
p*ssy like water, got no smell ain't got no flavor
She treat the tip of my d*ck like a waitress
She doing tricks on my d*ck cause I'm a skater
We've been drinkin' and they've been talkin'
But we ain't worried, we just look the other way
It's time to roll up and get it started
It's bout that time I've been feenin' all day
I want you right now
Right in the skate park, riding on your skateboard
You, right now

So I'ma wear that a*s out all night
You get hard d*ck all day, p*ssy always tight
And warmer than The North Face
Ooh talkin' crazy, d*ck gon' have you walkin' crazy
Round this b*tch lookin' handicapped
At least you'll get good parking spaces
Look at things on the bright side
Hit that a*s from the right side

Ooh girl, you gon' get this d*ck, we don't do romance
She ride the d*ck so fast, like look ma, no hands
Oh, I'ma pull her hair, I don't care if it ain't her hair

He slidin' through that half pipe while I'm ridin' on that skate board
Skate board, skate board
