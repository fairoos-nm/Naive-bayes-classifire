 Sitting in my Bugatti, thinking about money
I got paid Friday, I be counting til Monday
Bullshit fly by me, I'm ducking all the bad vibes
Louis on my body and up on my damn eyes
Holiday season, bitch!
Sit in my Bughatti, thinking about money
I got paid Friday, I be counting til Monday
Bullshit fly by me, I'm ducking all the bad vibes
Louis on my body and up on my damn eyes
Don't you ever try me, I'll murk whoever dare try
Shoot you 10 times just in case you got 9 lives
Yeah, I bet you up there getting baptized
It's Weezy Baby - but it's YOUR naptime
I told you I'mma fool with it
?
And if it's broke, let the Pro Tools fix it
I heard you got that

Ready for take-off
Now go hard on em Tune
? it look like bars on a room
Heavy like driving loads on them bitches
Like a flower and a Phantom
Top Rolls/rose on them bitches
No bullshit, no Derrick Rose on them bitches
My niggas bring me them bitches with no clothes on them bitches
I promise I do 2's 3's and 4's on them bitches, man
I do everything but perform for them bitches
Soo Woo to the Eastside
Cooker on my waist leave you bitch ass deep-fried
If you don't shoot me, you gonna get beat by it
Young M-O-N-E-Y
I am not a human being
I am every woman's dream
I am a lion, no, a lion king
I'm fly, no, I'm flier with my giant wings
I sin with a grin
I stick em like 10 on your chin
I spit out a grenade
then
I'm a soldier put in the army of
made men
Now drop it like it's hot, ho
And don't forget the baby like the motherfuckin octomom
Lock, load, bomb
The fireman bitch, it's stop, drop, roll time
