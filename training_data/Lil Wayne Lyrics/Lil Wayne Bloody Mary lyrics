 [Intro]
I'mma be alright because Dizzy alright[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Uh, ok, time to make my mark
I gave 'em a head start
Now I'm on my Nicki shit, I don't want no fraud
Tryna' raise the bar, grabbin' like I passed the bar
You would think I'm ridin' bikes by the way I handle bars
New nigga in charge, it's a new nigga in charge
Poppin' all these blue I might turn into an avatar
They ain't wanna see me back, he's back
Human cracking the flesh, sorry I had to relapse
These niggas weak wack, I twist 'em like weed raps
Still on my Nino Brown
Still getting G-money on G packs
No stunna man bussin like Dunna Man it's evident
These hoes love me, they say my dick is they medicine
Cosby spikin' gelatin, still pushin' and pedaling
Settling never, I'm like DiCaprio in The Revenant
Still whippin' and stretchin' it
2 pots, ambidextrous
I'm a beast, a dog, I see that money I'm catching it
Ya hoe throwing it at me, I'm catching it
Don't check me, go check ya bitch
You don't want to get me out of my element
From a tenant in a tenements to owning my residence
Phone still clicking I feel like a receptionist
I'm extraterrestrian
My life's a fucking movie, boy don't get yourself edited
I'm like Steph at the free-throw that piece blow, I never miss
Told you girl how to a whip the girl now she lesbian
You can level up, still won't be on my level then
It's level 10, these niggas hot, I must be kettling
They don't want the steam but I know you want the tea
That's yo bitch, why she only fuck with me?
Cause I'm balling MSG
Roof missing on this whip, and I need two kitchens
Fuck the DA I ain't never been no stool pigeon
Won't catch me in no club unless my tool get in
Be smart cause Bouncy a fool with it
Son say it's on
7-11 with it
That's 24-7 with it
Wherever, whatever with it, yeah
Your Momma gonna need a church with a reverend in it
Just pray its a heaven in it
And hope that they let you in it, yeah
Boy I expose the truth in guys
Cross me and get crucified
Wars on the bazooka rise
Niggas get neutralized[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Suicide, this is suicide
Tell 'em seek and you will find 'cause Imma lose my mind
Kick a nigga ass then give em my shoes to shine
It's do or die, I come from where we used to crime
The Uzi-9 more important than school supplies
The pools is dry, my niggas and the food is fried
The news is lies
The pigeons is too spooked to fly
The rules denied
All the toughest goons is mine
That's Tunechi's slimes
They kill you and go do the time
We unified
Young Money revolutionized the new design
We had to leave the flukes behind and super size
The numbers through the roof and sky
Don't look too surprised look through the lines
We makin' moves and strides, groves and vibes I'm too alive
These hoes need to be supervised
They put on a cute disguise, you grooms is blind
She get dick in the Uber ride, Number 2 with fries, I'm pimpin'
Now who am I?
I'm who and why, I'm rude and kind
My cars are computerized, I'm cruisin' by
Smokin' blunts Ruben size
You fools can try, these tools getting utilized, you euthanized
Blattt, skrrt, shoot then drive, now who survived?
We comin' back to rewind
I'm usually high, sippin' on the Houston wine
Feel humanized, I want my throne to recline
Jackie red, Julie blind, they cuban fine, I bruise they spine
I leave and they snooze till 9
Superglued to the grind, my crew my tribe
These bitches try to divide, we too divine
Got the drugs to provide, the coolest highs
The green is green and the white with the bluest eyes
The syrup and the juice collide
The two combine like suits and ties
Magic, poof
Goodbye
