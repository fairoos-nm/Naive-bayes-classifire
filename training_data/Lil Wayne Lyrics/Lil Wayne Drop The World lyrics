 I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyesHate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on motherfucker
'Cause all this bullshit, it made me strong motherfuckerSo I pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah!Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head
(YEAH) And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
Motherfucker I'm goneMotherfucker I'm gone
Uhhhh!I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven sent, and you're hell proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Uhhh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and that's a word from the wiseServed to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head, ha ha yeah!Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head
(YEAH) And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave EarthMotherfucker I'm gone
Motherfucker I'm gone
I'm gone
It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never knowIf only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push comes to shove I just stand up and scream 'Fuck 'em all! '
Man it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, but it's time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
my book of rhymes-got em cookin' boy
crooked mind of mine-got them all sAnd-scared to look in my-eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time
And I-came up from behind and- pretty much snuck up
And butt fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'm a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently bitch, it's beddy bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal, I'm unstoppable
Incredible hulk you're trapped in my medicine bowlI could run circles around you so fast your fuckin head'll spin, dawg
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives
I'll fuckin'
Pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah!Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
Motherfucker I'm gone
Motherfucker I'm gone
I'm gone
