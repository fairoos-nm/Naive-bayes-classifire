 Only once the drugs are done
That I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
That I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
That I feel like dying, I feel like dyingI am sittin on the clouds
I got smoke coming from my seat
I can play basketball with the moon
I got the whole world at my feet
Playin' touch football on Marijuana Street
Or in a marijuana field
You are so beneath my cleats
Get high, so high that I feel like flying
Down in a cigar
Roll me up & smoke me cause
I feel like dyingOnly once the drugs are done
That I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
That I feel like dying, I feel like dyingSwimming laps around a bottle of Louis The 13th
Jumping off of a mountain into a sea of CodineI'm at the top of the top but still I climb
And if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine
Pop, Pop, I feel like flying, then I feel like frying, then I feel like dyingOnly once the drugs are done
That I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
That I feel like dying, I feel like dyingI can mingle with the stars & throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanax bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
And violets are blue,
Roses are red
Daisies are yellow,
The flowers are dead
Wish I can give you this feeling that I feel like buying
And if my dealer don't have no more, then I feel like dyingOnly once the drugs are done
That I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
That I feel like dying, I feel like dying
