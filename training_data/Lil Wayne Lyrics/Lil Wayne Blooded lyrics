 (Lil Wayne talking)
Py til I die, just beacause, pyru, b's up, bitch I'm me(chorus)
Young mony is the label
Let us in the door, comin in this bitch all red to the floor
And I'm blooded soowoo and I'm blooded soowoo
I got bloods on stage bloods at my shows
F**k with my bloods got blood on your cloths
And I'm blooded soooowooo (2)Once again its on, yea I'm back in the booth
Stand at the top like a tac in the roof
Still on these hoes like a mack in a suit
Still on my toes not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talkin about me but I don't give a hoot
These niggas still lyin I'm the muthafukin truth
Talk tough till I knock off your kuff
And I own my team, I'm like a Maloof
They hatin on me I'm just tryin to be weezy
Just like young jeezy in da lima bean Ghini(Lamborghini)
Smoked out my mind baby and now I'm seein three of ya
Dope boy fresh from my fitted to my DC
All red so these hoes know who we be
We B's Bloods we B's
Popeye flow yea ya'll niggas sweet peas
Gettin high on a yacht call it seaweed(chorus)Yea, I advance my flow and they must like that
They like it so much, they say they write that
Barkin at the dog, but I don't bite back
I aint CPR I aint bringin they life back
Black CVR bad bitch on a bite back
Skittles on my wrist, yea nigga the bright pack
Ima shine, I live where da light at
Airforce fly call me a nike check
Brand new coupe same color as the sky
The dash say 2, lord know I'm gon try
Cop pull me over lord know I'm gon lie
They go up in my trunk lord know I'm gon fry
Them niggas throwin salt all over my fries
So ima just walk all over them guys
Niggas throwin darts never hit the bullseye
Young money bitch new orleans east side(chorus)Yea, been around the world rep the same thang
Been around the world its the same gang
B's up B's up flame gang blaaat blaaat blaaat bang bang
I tol my homie streets can't sleep on life
So he popped the X pill and didn't sleep all night
I aint worried bout you I'm just tryin do me
Last album did 2 I'm just tryin do 3
I am wat every pair of eyes oughta see
Bitches just wish they could call and order me
My momma used to tell me just get a 9 to 5
Cash money made her say never mind I'm fine
(B's up!)(chorus)
