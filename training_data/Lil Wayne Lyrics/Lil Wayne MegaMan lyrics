 Faded off the kush I'm gone
Only 2 years old when daddy used to bring them hookers home
Looking like my Grammo, my niggas got that ammo
We jack son then light up that "L", Samuel
Tunechi in this bitch nigga, y'all niggas bitch niggas
Rats gone rat and snakes gone hiss nigga
Baseball rich nigga, do this shit for all my homies
Where them bad bitches at? Come and put that p-ssy on me
Tunechi you a murderer, boy you just be killing shit
Yeah you know that money talk, I am the ventriloquist
Tranquilizer in the trunk, put your ass to sleep man
Birdman Jr. got the world in my wingspan
How you niggas want it? Have it your way, Burger King
I get deep in that p-ssy, dig her out, surgery
F-cking with a real nigga, f-cking right, certainly
Break in your f-cking home, take your life, burglary
Woah nigga, die slow nigga,
for dear life your holding on En Vogue nigga
Unload nigga, reload nigga, tools on deck, Home Depot nigga
Well if life is a bitch, then mine a gold digger
And all my bitches nasty like a cold dinner
Everyday I go so hard and work my ass off
I'm good, I'm 100 like a fastball
It's Carter 4!(Yeah)
(I'm going back in man)(Yeah)We get f-ck y'all money, how you want to play it?
That AK sleep on the side of my bed
That's one eye closed, one eye open
Your cap get peeled like ibuprofen
I'm sick, I'm ill, I ain't the nigga to f-ck with
This a crazy world and life is shorter than Bushwick
Young Money man we got this shit by a land slide
Boy I send them bloods at your ass like a tampon
Uptown shit, wet the whole party, Weezy gone ball
Ball like Steve Harvey, the heater I'm a tuck her
Tuck her like Dolores, that's my word like, word like the-saurus
I don't see no future in your fronting, I be stunting hard
Rap game dependent on me like a bungee cord
Fear nobody but God almighty
Shoot that motherf-cker till I get arthritis
I'm a beast, I'm a ass, I'm ahead of my class
I'm a diamond in the rough like a baby in the trash
I don't talk it, I live it. I paint a picture vivid
And them pistols popping like they sitting in a skilletI go so hard, I go so mean, I'm so New Orleans
Told the judge I couldn't budge, it was him or me
Forget the bullshit and remember me
