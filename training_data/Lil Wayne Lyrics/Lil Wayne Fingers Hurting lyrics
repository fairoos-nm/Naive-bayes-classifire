 She live in Fort Lauderdale and I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over, she said, "okay, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife and keep my house clean
I said shut the fuck up, put this dick back in your mouth please
I don't see nothing wrong with some mouth and lip service
Tunechi in this bitch, I'm tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch
I didn't answer my phone, I said I couldn't get service
My new nina just told me that she sick of being a virginBagging up the work for an hour, fingers hurtin
Let my bitches help, before they leave I check they purses
Sorry for the wait, the confusion, the disturbance
Got me movin' weight, prostitution, and these verses
Whippin' in this kitchen, in the trap house with my shirt off
I'ma get these millions and I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talkin' bout the third ward
The D.A. was a dick and the judge was a jerk off
Got a bad bitch body curvy like a curveball
Let her drank too much, now her pussy taste like Smirnoff
Sleepin' on chinchilla, boy, I'm cozy like a fur ball
Fuck the other side nigga we could have a turf war
Sorry for the wait I had to drop this part two and shit
Just to let you know that a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave on my Roots part two shit
Gotta let 'em know that Lil Tunechi is still Tunechi, bitch
Bop bop bop
Fuck with me wrong, get the hammer
Thank God I'm home from the slammer, was gone for the hammer
Stompin' the yard like a gamma, niggas was goin' bananas
I'm calm like a camel, I'm smokin' that strong like a camel
I bet my life when we gamble
Y'all shippin' keys, we shippin' grand pianos
I'm in that Lam Diablo, pew like ammo
I'm gone, two fingers up, bitch, I'm gone
Rich forever; Jerry Jones
I gotta hustle, keepin' my destiny going
Like the House of DerÃ©on
This plane that I'm on is private, my very ownSo no checkin' my carry-onsShe sent the picture naked, I said it's onShe live in Fort Lauderdale and I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over, she said, "okay, don't fall asleep"

My new nina just told me that she sick of being a virginNow I don't get excited nigga, I just get exotic
I don't get invited to these bitches pity parties
I don't do narcotic even though a nigga got it
Countin' all this money, I feel like I got arthritis
Baggin' up the work for a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help me, 'fore they leave I check their purses
Sorry for the wait, the confusion of disturbance
Got me movin' weight, prostitution and these verses
Whippin in the kitchen in the trap house with my shirt off
I'm gon' get these millions and I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talkin' 'bout the third ward
The DA was a dick and the judge was a jerk off
We yellin' suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Yeah, you hear us yellin', suwoop, suwoop, suwoop
Blood gang, nigga
And it's the Sorry 4 the Wait 2
And I'm so sorry for the wait too
Sorry for the wait, I had to drop that part two and shit
Just to let you know that a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave, talking Roots part two and shit
Sorry for the wait, Lil Tunechi still Tunechi, bitch
