 Ooooh
Run away, the past will bite again
Ooooh
No matter where you dwell
You
Here again, a captive of the howl
You
Welcome back to hellFaithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are collidingSharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you changeAm I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymoreOoooh
Tooth is fang, twisting under skin
Ooooh
Foul tongue, black breath
Change
Snap inside, the Beast about complete
Change
Soon infects the restFaithful, as the full moon is rising
Beauty and the Beast are collidingSharpened edge touch liquid flame
Deepened seed soaks anger's reign
Arching back, shape-shift derange
Father, how I watched you changeAm I savage?
Howling at the door
Am I savage?
I don't recognize you anymore
AnymoreOoooh
Inheritance, the past has bit again
Ooooh
The next heir of anarchy
Feel
Stretching skin so far beyond belief
I feel
The ever changing, you, in meAm I savage?
Scratching at the door
Am I savage?
Howling evermore
Am I savage?
I don't recognize me anymore
AnymoreAnymore, ha ha ha
Am I savage?
