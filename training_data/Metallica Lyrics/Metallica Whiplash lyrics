 Late at night, all systems go
You've come to see the show
We do our best, you're the rest
You make it real, you knowThere's a feeling, deep inside
That drives you fuckin' mad
A feeling, of a hammerhead
You need it oh so badAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!Bang your head against the stage
Like you never did before
Make it ring, make it bleed
Make it really soreIn a frenzied madness
With your leathers and your spikes
Heads are bobbing all around
It's hot as hell tonightAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Whiplash!Here on stage the Marshall noise
Is piercing through your ears
It kicks your ass, Kicks your face
Exploding feeling nearsNow's the time to let it rip
To let it fuckin' loose
We're gathered here to maim and kill
Cause this is what we chooseAdrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniacHere we go!(1st solo)Whiplash!(2nd solo)
The show is through, the metal's gone
It's time to hit the road
Another town, another gig
Again we will explode
Hotel rooms and motorways
Life out here is raw
We'll never stop, we'll never quit
Cause we're Metallica
Adrenaline starts to flow
You're thrashing all around
Acting like a maniac
Ow, ow!
