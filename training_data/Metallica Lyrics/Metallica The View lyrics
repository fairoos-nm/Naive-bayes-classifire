 I am a of the voices
That gather up the magnets
Set before meI attract you and repel you
A science of the heart
And blood and meaningThe coldness of most beauties
Is a challenge that our youth
Must quickly conquerThere is no time for guilt
Or second guessing, second guessing
Based on feelingI am the truth, the beauty
That causes you to cross
Your sacred boundariesI have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak
The purity of loveBut I worship the young
And just formed angelWho sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else
Bores me
I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning youve amassed
Like a fortuneOh throw it awayFor worship someone
Who actively despises youFor worship someone
Who actively despises youI am the root
I am the progress
Im the aggressor
I am the tablet
These ten storiesWorship
WorshipPain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
I offer them to you as servants
Of the gold that you must give
Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
And Ill offer them, I offer them to you
As servants of the gold
That you must give to meI want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up, give it up
Your your life of reasonI want to see you on the floorAnd in a coffin, soul shaking
Soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning youve amassed
Like a fortune, like a fortune
Throw it awayFor worship of someone
Who actively despises youWho actively despises youI am the view
I am the table
I am the view
I am the table
I am all this
I am the root, the progress
The aggressor, I am the table
I am the ten stories
I am the table!I AM!
