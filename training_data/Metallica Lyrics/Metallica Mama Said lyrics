 Mama she has taught me well
Told me when i was young
"son your life's an open book
Don't close it 'fore its done"
"the brightest flame burns quickest"
That's what i heard her say
A son's heart sowed to mother
But i must find my way
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Yeah still
Rebel mind your last name
Wild blood in my veins
They bring strings around my neck
The mark that still remains
Left home at an early age
Of what i heard was wrong
I never asked forgiveness
But what is said is done
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
So let this heart be still
Mama, now i'm coming home
I'm not all you wished of me
A mother's love for her son
Spoken, help me be
I took your love for granted
Not a thing you said to me
I needed your arms to welcome me
But, a cold stone's all i see
Let my heart go
Let your son grow
Mama, let my heart go
Let this heart be still
Let my heart go
Mama, let my heart go
You never let my heart go
So let this heart be still
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Never i ask of you
But never i gave
But you gave me your emptiness that i'll take to my grave
Let this heart be still
