 My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
There's a dog at your back step
He must come in from the rain
I fall 'cause I let goThe net below has rot away
So, my eyes seek realityAnd my fingers seek my veins
The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to seeWhat I've let me be
So, wicked and wornSo, as I write to you
Of what is done and to do
Maybe you'll understandAnd won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive meMy eyes seek realityMy fingers feel for faith
Touch clean with a dirty hand
I touched the clean to the waste
The trash fire is warm
But nowhere safe from the stormAnd I can't bear to see
What I've let me beSo, wicked and worn
So, as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeahMaybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive mePlease forgive me
So, low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So, you bring this poor dog in from the rainThough he just wants right back out again
And I cry to the alleywayConfess all to the rain
But I lie, lie straight to the mirror
The one I've broken to match my face
The trash fire is warmBut nowhere safe from the storm
And I can't bear to see
What I've let me be
So, wicked and worn
So, as I write to you, yeah
Of what is done and to do, yeah
Maybe you'll understand
And won't cry for this man
'Cause low man is due
Please forgive me
Please forgive me
So, low the sky is all I see
All I want from you is forgive me
So, you bring this poor dog in from the rain
Though he just wants right back out again
My eyes seek reality
My fingers seek my veins
