 Suppose I say
I'm never satisfied
Suppose I say
he cuts the roots
To make the tree surviveJust let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once
I'm oh so bored to deathOh, I hunger
I hunger
I eatBorn into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever
What ever happened to sweat?Suppose I say
The vultures smile at me
Suppose I say
I sent them down
They plan to pick you cleanAnd satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone
Gone, yeah, and gone againOh, I hunger
Oh, I hunger
I eatBorn into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand thereBorn into attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever
What ever happened to sweat?Just let me kill you for a while
Just let me kill you for a smile
Just let me kill you once for me
I'm oh so bored to deathAnd satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction this way comes
And satisfaction's here and gone
Gone, gone againYeah, I hunger
Oh, I hunger
I eat
Born into attitude
Asleep at the wheel
Throw all your bullets in the fire
And stand there
Born into attitude
Twist mother tongue
Throwing all your bullets in the fire
And run like hell
Why cure the fever
What ever happened to sweat?
