 All roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
All reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolverAll hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolverEven the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck it 'til it's gone dryFor all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolverRedemption purify
Will nothing satisfy
The scars just multiply
In the shine of the midnight revolverTwisting in apocalypse
Death upon the fingertips
Frigid metal touches lips
And the shine of the midnight revolver'Cause you liedJust a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my headCaressing death again
Becomes the heroin
Forbidden medicine
Puts a shine on the midnight revolverEternal borderline
All the faces intertwine
Oh God ... now I see mine
In the shine of the midnight revolverEven the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck ... suck till it's dryFor all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolverDown In Misery
Down In MiseryJust a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my headAll roads they lead to shame
All drowning in the blame
Reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolverAll hide beneath a skin
A hope so paper thin
I'm at the door again
And the shine of the midnight revolver
Even the promise of danger has gone dull
Staring down the barrel of a 45
Suck on the barrel
Suck on the barrel
Suck ... suck till it's dry
Do all reflections look the same
In the shine of the midnight revolver
'Cause you lied
Yes you lied
Just a bullet away
Just a bullet away from leavin' you
Just a bullet away
Stop the voices in my head
