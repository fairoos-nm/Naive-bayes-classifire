 A-haha!
Oh yeahLiving and dying laughing and cryingOnce you have seen it you will never be the same
Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
Hard and it is heavy and dirty and mean
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't
Take it
Any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fastIt is
Going to
Take your breath away
Don't stop for nothing it's full speed or nothingI am taking down you know whatever is in my way
Getting your kicks as you are shooting the line
Sending the shivers up and down my spine
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't
Take it
Any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fastIt is
Going to
Take your breath away
Those people who tell you not to take chancesThey are all missing on what life is about
You only live once so take hold of the chance
Don't end up like others the same song and dance
Motorbreath
It's how I live my life
I can't
Take it
Any other way
Motorbreath
The sign of living fast
It is
Going to
Take your breath away
