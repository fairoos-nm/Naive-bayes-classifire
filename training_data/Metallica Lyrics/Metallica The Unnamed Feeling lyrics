 Been here before, been here before
Been here before, been here beforeBeen here before couldn't say I liked it
Do I start writing all this down?
Just let me plug you into my world
Can't you help me be un crazy?Name this for me, heat the cold air
Take the chill off of my life
And if I could I'd turn my eyes
To look inside to see what's comin'It comes alive, it comes alive
It comes alive and I die a little more
It comes alive, it comes alive
It comes alive each moment here I die a little more
Ooh, I die, I die, I die a little moreThen the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Takes me awayBeen here before, been here before
Been here before, been here before
Been here before, been here beforeI'm frantic in your soothing arms
I can not sleep in this down filled world
I've found safety in this loneliness
But I cannot stand it anymoreI cross my heart and hope not to die
Swallow evil, ride the sky
Lose myself in a crowded room
You fool, you fool, it will be here soonIt comes alive, it comes alive
It comes alive and I die a little more
It comes alive, it comes alive
It comes alive each moment here I die a little more
Ooh, I die, I die, I die a little moreThen the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this wayAnd I wait for this train
Toes over the line
And then the unnamed feeling
It takes me away
It takes meThen the unnamed feeling
It comes alive, yeah-e-yeah
Then the unnamed feeling
It takes me away
Yeah, it takes me awayGet the fuck out of here
I just wanna get the fuck away from me
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
It hate it all, why, why, why me?I cannot sleep with a head like this
I wanna cry, I wanna scream
I rage, I glaze, I hurt, I hate
I wanna hate it all awayThen the unnamed feeling
It comes alive, yeah-e-yeah
Then the unnamed feeling
Treats me this way, yeahThen I wait for this train
My toes are over the line, yeah
Then the unnamed feeling
It takes me away
Yeah, it takes me awayThen the unnamed feeling
It comes alive
Then the unnamed feeling
It takes me away
