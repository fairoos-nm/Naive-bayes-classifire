 You just stood there screaming
Fearing no one was listening to you
They say the empty can rattles the most
The sound of your own voice must suit you
Hearing only what you want to hear
And knowing only what you've heardYou, you're smothered in tragedy
And you're off to save the world
MiseryYou insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
MiseryThere's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery
You still stood there screamingNo one caring about these words you tell
My friend before your voice is gone
One man's fun is another's hell
These times are sent to try men's souls
But something's wrong with all you see
You, you'll take it on all yourselfRemember, misery loves company
Misery
You insist that the weight of the worldShould be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you seeMy friend of misery, my friend of misery
You just stood there screaming
My friend of miseryMisery
You insist that the weight of the world
Should be on your shoulders
Misery
There's much more to life than what you see
My friend of misery, my friend of misery
You just stood there screaming
My friend of misery
Yeah, yeah, go
