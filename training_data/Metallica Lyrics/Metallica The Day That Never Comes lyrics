 Born to push you around
Better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the groundMouths so full of lies
Tend to block your eyes
Just keep them closed
Keep praying
Just keep waitingWaiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no
No, the sunshine never comesPush you 'cross that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your timeGod, I'll make them pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this grayWaiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comesLove is a four-letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four-letter word
Here in this prisonI suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this, I swear
This, I swear
The sun will shine
This, I swear
This, I swear
This, I swear
