 Lay beside me
Tell me what they've done
Speak the words I wanna hear
To make my demons run
The door is locked now
But it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me
Then I can understand the youLay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night
We share this paralyze
The door cracks open
But there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still
But there's no sun shining through
No there's no sun shining through
No there's no sun shiningWhat I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?Come lay beside me
This won't hurt I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still
But she'll never love again
She lay beside me
But she'll be there when I'm gone
Black hearts scarring darker still
Yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be thereWhat I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?Lay beside me
Tell me what I've done
The door is closed so are your eyes
But now I see the sun
Now I see the sun
Yes now I see itWhat I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you
Yeah, what I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
'Cause I'm the one who waits
The one who waits for youOh, what I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Oh, what I've felt
Oh, what I've known
I'll take this key and I'll bury it in you
Because you're unforgiven too
Never free, never me
'Cause you're unforgiven too
