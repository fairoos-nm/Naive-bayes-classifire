Never hunger
Never prosperI have fallen prey to failure
Struggle within
Triggered againNow the candle burns at both ends
Twisting under schizophreniaFalling deep into dementia
...
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Everyone's after me
Frayed ends of sanityHear them calling
Hear them calling me
...Birth of terror
Death of much more
I'm the slave of fear, my captorNever warnings
Spreading its wingsAs I wait for the horror she brings
Loss of interest, question, wonder
Waves of fear they pull me under
...
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracyEveryone's after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them callingHear them calling me
...
Solo: Kirk...
Into ruinI am sinking
Hostage of this nameless feeling
Hell is set free
Flooded I'll be
Feel the undertow inside me
Height, Hell, Time, Haste, Terror, Tension
Life, Death, Want, Waste, Mass Depression
...
Old habits reappear
Fighting the fear of fear
Growing conspiracy
Myself is after me
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Frayed ends of sanity
Hear them calling
Hear them calling me
