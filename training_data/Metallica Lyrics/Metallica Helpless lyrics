 I've gotta see you moving fast, see you come my way
see the dreams, i hope they last, never fade away
gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight
gotta set it all afire, set it all alight
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar
i am gonna set you all alight
gotta make it man
i ain't got a choice
gotta fill this hall tonight
Helpless (helpless)
helpless (helpless)
helpless (helpless)
helpless (helpless)
I don't know what i'm gonna do, maybe not tonight
gotta set you all afire, gotta treat you right
i can see the flashing lights, lit before your love
gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar
i am gonna set you all alight
gotta make it man, i ain't got a choice
gotta fill this hall tonight
Helpless (helpless)
helpless (helpless)
helpless (helpless)
helpless (helpless)
huh!
I can see the stars, but i can't see what's going on
every night alone i sing my song just for fun
only time will tell if i'll make it myself someday
this stage is mine, music is my destiny
Cannot squeeze the life from me, yeah
