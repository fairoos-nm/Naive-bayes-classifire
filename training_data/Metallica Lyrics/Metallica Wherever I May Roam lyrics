 And the road becomes my bride
And the road becomes my bride
I have stripped of all but pride, so in her I do confide
And she keeps me satisfied, gives me all I need
And with dust in throat I craveOnly knowledge will I save, to the game you stay a slave
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you willBut I'll take my time anywhere
Free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll redefine anywhereAnywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home
And the earth becomes my throne
And the earth becomes my throneI adapt to the unknown, under wandering stars I've grown
By myself but not alone, I ask no oneAnd my ties are severed clean
The less I have the more I gain, off the beaten path I reign
Rover, wanderer, nomad, vagabond
Call me what you will, But I'll take my time anywhereI'm free to speak my mind anywhere
And I'll never mind anywhere
Anywhere I roam, where I lay my head is homeBut I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind
And I'll take my time anywhereAnywhere I roam, where I lay my head is home
But I'll take my time anywhere
I'm free to speak my mind anywhereAnd I'll redefine anywhere
Anywhere I roam, where I lay my head is homeCarved upon my stone
My body lie but still I roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may wander, wander, wander
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
Wherever I may roam
