 You dont actually care
Love for you is no beginning
Youre not really there
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
HallucinationI understand you think youre above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hairThey run through your hair
Hallucination
HallucinationOh you think youre so special
That theres no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
Were mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals belowAre meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks withPoor pitiful creatureThe winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocyAn idiots idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think were a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when youre ableRed star of idiocy
An idiots idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature
To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshippersWe do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect bodyThe hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You dont even see us
You were never caringYou go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
Youre way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dyingIm clawing your chest
Til your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples til I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukeboxIm doomed, Im swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightieYour leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?
The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?Youre way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiots idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
Youre way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiots idiocyMy caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dyingYoure way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner,
Its true
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocyAn idiots idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons

Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants
Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh, oh, oh youre so special
