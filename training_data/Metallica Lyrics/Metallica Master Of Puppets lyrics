 End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear
Sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's constructionTaste me, you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing youCome crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master
MasterMaster of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
MasterNeedlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirrorTaste me, you will see
More is all you need
You're dedicated to
How I'm killing youCome crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master
MasterMaster of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master
Master
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream

Master(Solo #1)Master
Master
Where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master
Master
You promised only lies
Laughter
Laughter
All I hear or see is laughter
Laughter
Laughter
Laughing at my cries
Fix me(Solo #2)Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of seasonI will occupy
I will help you die
I will run through you
Now I rule you, tooCome crawling faster
Obey your master
Your life burns faster
Obey your Master
MasterMaster of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master

Just call my name, 'cause I'll hear you scream
