 No life till leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming it's right
Well alright
When we start to rock, we never
Wanna stop againHit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lightsYou know our fans are insane
We are gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today, the only way
When we start to rock, we never
Wanna stop againHit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lightsWith all our screaming
We're gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It is causing you sweet pain, oh sweet pain
When we start to rock, we never
Wanna stop again
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit them lights
