 Born to push you around,
Better just stay down,You put away,
He hits the flesh,
You hit the ground,
Mouth so full of lies,
Tend to black your eyes,Just keep them closed,
Keep praying just keep waiting,Waiting for the one,
The day that never comes,
When you stand up and feel the warmth,
But the sunshine never comes,No the sunshine never comesPushed you across that line,
Just stay down this time,Hide in yourself,
Crawl in yourself,
You'll have your time,God I'll make them pay,
Take you back one day,
I'll end this day,
I'll splatter color on this gray,Waiting for the one,
The day that never comes,
When you stand up and feel the warmth,
But the sunshine never comes,Love is a fallen word,
And never spoken here,
Love is a fallen word,
Here in this prison,I suffer this no longer,
I'll put an end to,
This I swear, This I swear,The sun will shine,
This I swear, This I swear,
This I swear
