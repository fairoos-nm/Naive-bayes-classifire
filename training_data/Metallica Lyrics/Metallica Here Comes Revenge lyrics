 Little grave I'm grieving, I will mend you
Sweet revenge I'm dreaming, I will end youI've been here since dawn of time
Countless hatreds built my shrine
I was born in anger's flame
He was Abel, I was Cain
I am here
I'm hell unbound
Burn your kingdom to the ground
To the groundHere comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, it's killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revengeI return this nightmare, I will find you
Sleepless, cloaked in despair, I'm behind youMan has made me oh so strong
Blurring lines of right and wrong
Far too late for frail amends
Now it's come to sweet revenge
Desperate hands
That lose control
Have no mercy on your soul
On your soulHere comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revengeHere comes revenge, just for you
Revenge, you can't undo
Revenge, is killing me
Revenge, set me free
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth
A life for a life, it's my burden of proof
Revenge, just for you
Revenge
You ask forgiveness, I give you sweet revengeSweet revenge
