 There's a black cloud overhead
That's me
And the poison ivy chokes the tree
Again it's me
I'm the filthy one on Bourbon Street
You walk on by
I'm the little boy that pushes hard
And makes it cryThere's a dirty needle in your child
Haha, stick me
Empty bottles still in hand, still dead
Still me
I'm the suit and tie that breaks the street
And still wants more
I'm the 45 that's in your mouth
I'm a dirty, dirty whoreYeah
Look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see
Hey
Look it's me
When no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see
Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's meYeah
He wants to become father now
Me again, me
The marks inside your arms spell me, spell only me.
I'm the nothing face that plants a bomb
And strolls away
I'm the one who doesn't look quite right
As children playYeah
Look it's me
The one who can't be free
Much too young to focus
But too old to see
Hey
Look it's me
When no one wants to see
See what you brought this world
Just what you wanna see
Hey ma
Hey ma, look it's me
It's meLook up to me
What you've been and what you've feared
Look up to me
Look it's me, what you hear
See right through me
See the one who can't be free
See right through me
