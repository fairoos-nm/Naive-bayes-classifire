 Open doors so I walk inside
Close my eyes
Find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it inLet the show begin
Open my eyes
Just to have them close again
Well on my wayBut on my way to where I've been
It swallows me
As it takes me in it's fog
I twist awayAs I give this world a nod
Open doors so I walk inside
Close my eyes
Find my place to hideAnd I shake as I take it in
Let the show begin
Open my eyes
Just to have them close once again
Don't want controlAs it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon
Or just a light that lights this dead end street?
Is that you thereOr just another demon that I meet?
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walkThe farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tilts
Step into the house that jack builtThe higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walkThe farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tiltsYes this is the house that jack built
Open doors as I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take this inLet the show begin
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walkThe farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tilts
Yes this is the house that jack built
The higher you are
The farther you fall
The longer the walk
The farther you crawl
My body my temple
This temple it tilts
"yes I am I am I am"
Open my eyes
It swallows me
Is that you there
I twist away
Away
Away
Away
