 Outta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of timeHeadstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
you've arrived
But now it's time
To kiss your ass good-byeDragging me down
Why you around?
So uselessIt ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitchIt ain't my bitchDown on the sun
Down and no fun
Down and out where the hell ya been?
Damn it all down
Damn it unbound
Damn it all down to hell againStand tall
Can't fall
Never even bend at all before
you've arrived
But now it's time
To kiss your ass good-byeDragging me down
Why you around?
So uselessIt ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitchOutta my wayOutta my way
Outta my day
Out of your mind and into mine
Into no one
Into not one
Into your step but out of timeHeadstrong
What's wrong?
I've already heard this song before
You've arrived
But now it's time
To kiss your ass good-bye
And now it's time to kiss your ass good-byeDragging me down
Why you around?
So uselessIt ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitchNo way but down
Why you're around?
No foolin'It ain't my smile
It ain't my style
It ain't my bitch
Oh, it ain't mine
Ain't mine
Your kind
Your stepin' out of time
Ain't mine
Your kind
Your stepin' out of time
Dragging me down
Why you around?
No foolin'
It ain't my fall
It ain't my call
It ain't my bitch
You ain't mine
