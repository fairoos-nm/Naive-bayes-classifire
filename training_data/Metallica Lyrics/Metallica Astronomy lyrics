 The clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place?
Like acid and oil on a madman's face
His reasons tend to fly awayLike lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
Now the sands become a crust
And most of you have gone away...
Yea, gone awayAh, come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you'll soon be married
And you'll want to know where winds come fromWell, it's never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the four winds bar, mm, yeahYeah
Hey!
Hey!

Two doors locked, ten windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey!
Hey! Yeah!
Hey! Yeah!

The other one's a duplicate
The queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Yes, the light that never, never warms
Never warms, never warmsThe clock strikes twelve and moondrops burst
Out at you from their hiding place?

And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly

These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog, fixed and consequentAstronomy - a star
