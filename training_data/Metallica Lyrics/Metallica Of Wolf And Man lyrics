 Off through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
I hunt
Therefore I am
Harvest the land
Taking of the fallen lambOff through the new day's mist I run
Out from the new day's mist I have come
We shift
Pulsing with the earth
Company we keep
Roaming the land while you sleepShape shift
Nose to the wind
Shape shift
Feeling I've been
Move swift
All senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning of life
Bright is the moon high in starlightChill in the air cold as steel tonight
We shift
Call of the wild
Fear in your eyes
It's later than you realized
Shape shiftNose to the wind
Shape shift
Feeling I've been
Move swift
All senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning of life
I feel a change
Back to a better dayHair stands on the back of my neck
In wildness is the preservation of the world
So seek the wolf in thyself
Shape shift
Nose to the windShape shift
Feeling I have been
Move swift
All senses clean
Earth's gift
Back to the meaning
Of wolf and man, yeah
