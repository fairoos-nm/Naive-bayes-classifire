 Open doors, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show beginOpen my eyes, just to have them close again
Well on my way, but on my way to where I've been
It swallows me as it takes me in its fog
I twist away as I give this world a nodOpen doors, so I walk inside
Close my eyes, find my place to hide
And I shake as I take it in
Let the show beginOpen my eyes, just to have them close once again
Don't want control as it takes me down and down and down again
Is that the moon or just a light that lights this dead end street?
Is that you there or just another demon that I meet?The higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl
My body, my temple, this temple it tilts
Step into the house that Jack builtThe higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl
My body, my temple, this temple it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack built, yeahOpen doors, as I walk inside
Swallow me so the pain subsides
And I shake as I take this in
Let the show beginLet the show begin
Let the show beginThe higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl
My body, my temple, this temple it tilts
Yes, this is the house that Jack builtThe higher you are, the farther you fall
The longer the walk, the farther you crawl
My body, my temple, this temple it tilts
Yes, I am, I am, I amOpen my eyes, it swallows me
Is that you there? I twist away
Away, away, away
