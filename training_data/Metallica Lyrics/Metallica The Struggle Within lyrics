 Reaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was realKicking at a dead horse pleases you
No way of showing your gratitude
S-s-so many things you don't want to do
What is it? What have you got to loseWhat the hell? What the hell?
What is that you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite, hypocrite
Boredom sets into the boring mindStruggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruined
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling withinHome is not a home it becomes a hell
Turning it into your prison cell
Advantages are taken, not handed out
While you struggle inside your hellReaching out, reaching out
Grabbing for something you've got to feel
Closing in, closing in
The pressure upon you is so unrealStruggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruined
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, struggling withinStruggle
Solo
Don'tReaching out for something you've got to feel
While clutching to what you had thought was real
What the hell? What is you think you're gonna find?
Hypocrite, boredom sets into the boring mind
Struggle within, it suits you fine
Struggle within, your ruined
Struggle within, you seal your own coffin
Struggle within, the struggling within
