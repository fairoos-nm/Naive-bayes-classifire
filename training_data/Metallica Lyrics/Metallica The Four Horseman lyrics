 By the last breath the fourth winds blow
Better raise your ears
The sound of hooves knock at your door
Lock up your wife and children now
It's time to wield the blade
For now you've got some companyThe Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With The Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and dieOH, YEAH YEAH!
You have been dying since the day you were born
You know it's all been planned
The quartet of deliverance rides
A sinner once, a sinner twice
No need for confessions now'Cause now you've got the fight of your life
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With The Four Horsemen rideOr choose your fate and die
OH, YEAH YEAH!
Time
has taken its toll on you
The lines that crack your face
Famine
your body it has torn through
Withered in every place
Pestilence
for what you had to endure
And what you have put others through
Deathdeliverance for you for sure
Now there's nothing you can do
So gather 'round young warriors now
And saddle up your steeds
Killing scores with demon swords
Now is the death of doers of wrongSwing the judgement hammer down
Safely inside armor blood guts and sweat
The Horsemen are drawing nearer
On leather steeds they ride
They've come to take your life
On through the dead of night
With The Four Horsemen ride
Or choose your fate and die
OH, YEAH YEAH!
