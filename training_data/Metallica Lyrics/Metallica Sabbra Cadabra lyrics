 Feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady always on my mind
She gives me loving every night and day
Never gonna leave her, never going awaySomeone to love me
You know she makes me feel all right, yeah (all right)
Someone to need me
Love me every single night, yeahFeel so happy since I met that girl
When I'm with her
It's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that girl 'til the end of timeSomeone to live for
Love me 'til the end of time, hey, hey-yeah
She makes me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mineI am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime
I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceivedYou gotta believe me
Hey, I'm talking to youWell, I know, it's hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on, hahaWo-ooh
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we're making love
It's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Gonna love that woman 'til the end of time
Someone to live for
Love me 'til the end of time, yeah, ooh, oh
She makes me feel happy
It's good to know that she's all mine
She's all mine, yeah
Yo, ooh, yeah
