 He sleeps under black seas waiting
Lies dreaming in death
He sleeps under cosmos shaking
Stars granting his breathHe wakes as the world dies screaming
All horrors arrive
He wakes giving earth its bleeding
Pure madness aliveAnd He haunts you
And He blinds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it allYou turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they sayCthulhu awakenHe sways in abyss returning
Inhaling black skies
He shakes with a torture burning
All lost in his eyesAnd He haunts you
And He blinds your soul
And He loathes you
And reclaims it allYou turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they sayCthulhu awakenYou turn to stone
Can't look away
You turn to stone
Madness, they saySanity taken
Seething damnation
Cthulhu awaken
(Wake) Winged Salvation
Death by creation
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no moreCthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
Cthulhu, awaken
(Wake) Dreaming no more
