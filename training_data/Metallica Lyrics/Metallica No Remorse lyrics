 No mercy for what we are doing
No thought to even what we have done
We don't need to feel the sorrow
No remorse for the helpless oneWar without endNo remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breathNo remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breathBlood feeds the war machine
As it eats its way across the land
We don't need the feel the sorrow
No remorse is the one commandWar without endNo remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breathNo remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breathOnly the strong survive
No one to save the weaker race
We are ready to kill all comers
Like a loaded gun right at your faceWar without endNo remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breathNo remorse, no repent
We don't care what it meant
Another day, another death
Another sorrow, another breath
Attack
Bullets are flying, people are dying
With madness surrounding all hell's breaking loose
Soldiers are hounding, bodies are mounting
Cannons are shouting to take their abuse
With war machines going, blood starts to flowing
No mercy given to anyone here
The furious fighting, swords are like lighting
It all becomes frightening to you know death is near
No remorse
