 I look at you then you me
Hungry and thirsty are we
Holding the lion's share, holding the key
Holding me back 'cause I'm striving to be(Better than you)
(Better than you)Lock horns I push and I strive
Somehow I feel more alive
Bury the need for it, bury the seed
Bury me deep where there's no will to be(Better than you)
(Better than you)Oh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, no, nothing brings me down
No, I can't stop this train from rolling on and on, on
No, no, forever holding onOh, can't stop this train from rolling
Oh, yo, you can't take it down
No, never stop this locomotion, on and on and on and on
No, you can't bring it down'Cause I'm better than you
(Better than you)
(Better than you)Oh, better than you
(Better than you)
(Better than you)
Much better than you(Better than you)
Oh, better than you
(Better than you)(Better than you)
Better than, better than
Better than, better than you, yeahCan't stop this train from rolling
Forever on and on and on and on and on
Forever on and on and onBetter than you, yeah
