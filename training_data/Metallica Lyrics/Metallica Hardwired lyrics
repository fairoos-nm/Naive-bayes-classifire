 In the name of desperation
In the name of wretched pain
In the name of all creation
Gone insaneWe're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destructGO!On the way to paranoia
On the crooked borderline
On the way to great destroyer
Doom designWe're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destructOH!Once upon a planet burning
Once upon a flame
Once upon a fear returning
All in vain
Do you feel that hope is fading?
Do you comprehend?
Do you feel it terminating?
In the endWe're so fucked
Shit outta luck
Hardwired to self-destruct
Hardwired to self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct
Self-destruct
