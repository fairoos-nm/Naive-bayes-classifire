 Obey, obey
Come won't you stay
Sincere, sincere
All ends in tears
Endure, endure
Thoughts most impure
Concede, concede
But both shall we bleedOh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on fireAllure, allure
Sweetness obscure
Abide, abide
Secrets inside
Deprive, deprive
To feel so alive
Obey, obey
Just don't turn awayOh, Halo on fire
The midnight knows it well
Fast, is desire
Creates another hell
I fear to turn on the light
For the darkness won't go away
Fast, is desire
Turn out the light
Halo on firePrayers cannot get through
Return to sender
Unto which of you
Shall I surrender
Twisting in disguise
Dark resurrection
Lighting up the skies
Wicked perfectionToo dark to sleep
Can't slip away
Open or close
My eyes betray
Beyond the black
Come won't you stayHello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye
Hello darkness, say goodbye
