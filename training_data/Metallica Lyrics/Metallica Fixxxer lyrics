 Yeah
Dolls of voodoo all stuck with pins
One for each of us and our sins
So you lay us in a line
Push your pins
They make us humble
Only you can tell in timeIf we fall or merely stumble
But tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain freeYou jab another pinJab another pin in me
Yeah
Mirror, mirror upon thy wall
Break this spell or become the doll
See you sharpening the pinsSo the holes will remind us
We're just the toys in the hands of anotherAnd in time the needles turn from shine to rust
But tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?
Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in meJab it...
Here come the pins...
(Kirk slide solo)
Blood for face
Sweat for dirt
Three X's for the stone
To break this curse
A ritual's due
I believe I'm not alone
Shell of shotgun
Pint of gin
Numb us up to shield the pins
Renew our faithWhich way we can
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life again
To fall in love with life againTo fall in love
To fall in love
To fall in love with life again
So tell me
Can you heal what father's done?
Or fix this hole in a mother's son?Can you heal the broken worlds within?
Can you strip away so we may start again?
Yeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done?
Or cut this rope and let us run?
Just when all seems fine and I'm pain free
You jab another pin
Jab another pin in me, yeah!
No more pins in me, yeah!
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more pins in me
No more, no more, no more
No, no, no...
