 Guilty as charged
But damn it, it ain't right
There's someone else controlling meDeath in the air
Strapped in the electric chair
This can't be happening to meWho made you God to say?
I'll take your life from youFlash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flamesWait for the sign
To flick the switch of death
It's the beginning of the endSweat, chilling cold
As I watch death unfold
Consciousness my only friendMy fingers grip with fear
What am I doing here?Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flamesSomeone help me
Oh please, God help me
They're trying to take it all away
I don't want to die(SOLO)
Someone help me
Oh please, God help meThey are trying to take it all away
I don't want to die
Time moving slowThe minutes seem like hours
The final curtain call I see
Im through with this
Just get it over with
If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by a horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream
Flash before my eyes
Now it's time to die
Burning in my brain
I can feel the flames
