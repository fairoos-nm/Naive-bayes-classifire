 Do unto others
As they've done to you
But what the hell is
This world coming to?Blow the universe
Into nothingness
Nuclear warfare
Shall lay us to restFight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fearWe all shall dieTime is like a fuse
Short and burning fast
Armageddon's here
Like said in the pastFight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fear-Solo-Soon to fill our lungs
The hot winds of death
The Gods are laughing
So take your last breathFight fire with fire
Ending is near
Fight fire with fire
Bursting with fearFight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight fire with fire
Fight
