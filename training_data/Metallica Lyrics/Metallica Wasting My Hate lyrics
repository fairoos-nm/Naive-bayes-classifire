 Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on youAin't gonna waste my hate
Ain't gonna waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it for myselfAin't gonna give no more
Ain't got the time to help you score
I think it's time you pleased yourself
YourselfGood day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, don't waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on youWaste my hate on youThink you're worthy now
You think enough to even raise the brow
And to laugh and tip that two pronged crownWell, I see my hands, I see my feet
I feel that blood that pumps in me
Where the hell's my mind goin' now?
goin' now?Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on youWaste my hate on you
Think I'll keep it for myselfAin't gonna waste my hate
But I'm so greedy when they say
Better to give than to receiveAin't gonna waste my hate, no, no
Ain't got time to waste my hate on you
I think I'll keep it all for myself
For myself
Good day, how do?
And I send a smile to you
Don't waste, don't waste your breath
And I won't waste my hate on you
Waste my hate on you
Think I'll keep it for myself
