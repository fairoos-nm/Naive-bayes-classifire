 Blackened is the endWinter it will send
Throwing all you see
Into obscurityDeath of Mother Earth
Never a rebirth
Evolution's end
Never will it mendNeverFire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackenedBlistering of earth
Terminate its worth
Deadly nicotine
Kills what might have beenCallous frigid chill
Nothing left to kill
Never seen before
Breathing nevermoreNeverFire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Color our world blackenedBlackenedOpposition... contradiction... premonition... compromise
Agitation... violation... mutilation... planet diesDarkest color
Blistered earth
True death of lifeTermination... expiration... cancellation... human race
Expectation... liberation... population... lay to wasteSee our mother
Put to death
See our mother dieSmoldering decay
Take her breath away
Millions of our years
In minutes disappearsDarkening in vain
Decadence remains
All is said and done
Never is the sunNeverFire
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Blackened is the end
To begin whipping dance of the dead
Fire
Is the outcome of hypocrisy
Darkest potency
In the exit of humanity
Color our world blackenedBlackened
