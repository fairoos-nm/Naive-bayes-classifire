 I see my reflection in my window
It looks different, so different than what you see
Projecting judgment on the world
This house is clean baby
This house is cleanAm I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Am I who I think I am?
Look out my window and see it's gone wrong
Court is in session and I slam my gavel down
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner too
I'm judge and I'm jury and I'm executioner tooProjector, Protector, Rejector, Infector, Projector

This window clean inside, dirty on the out
I'm looking different than me
