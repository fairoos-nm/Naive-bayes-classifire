 Forgive me father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty of the life
I feel withinWhen I'm branded this mark of shame
Should I look down, disgraced
Or straight ahead
And know that you must blameI am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn withinForgive me father
For I have sinned
Find me guilty when true guilt
Is from withinSo point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are weI am, I am the secret
I am, I am the sin
I am, I am the guilty
And I, I am the thorn withinI do your time
I take your fall
I'm branded guilty
For us allSo point your fingers
Point right at me
For I am shadows and will follow you
One and the same are weI am, I am your secrets
I am, I am your sin
I am, I am your guilty
And I, I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within
I am the thorn within
