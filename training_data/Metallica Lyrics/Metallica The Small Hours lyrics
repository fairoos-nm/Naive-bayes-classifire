 Look hard at the darkness
And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be thereYou cannot touch me
You would not dare
I am the chill that's in the airAnd I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the dayDark rivers are flowing
Back into the past
You are the fish for which I castAnd what of the future
What is to be
As the rivers flow into the seaAnd I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the dayDo not take for granted
Powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lairTime is an illusion,
Rising from time,
Steep is the mountain which we climb.And I try to get through to you,
In my own special way,
As the barriers crumble,
At the end of the day
