 I won't go away
Right, right here I stay
Stand silent in flames
Stand tall 'till it fadesShoot me again, I aint dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I aint dead yet
I said shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I aint dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again, come on
Shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me again, come onAll the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you
All the shots, all the shots
All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at youI won't go away, with a bullet in my back
Right here I stay, with a bullet in my backShoot me (Take a shot)
Shoot me (Take a shot)
Shoot me (Take a shot)
Shoot me (Take a shot)I stand on my own, with a bullet in my back
I'm stranded and sold, with a bullet in my backShoot me again, I aint dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I aint dead yet
Yeah, shoot me again, I ain't dead yet
Come on, shoot me again, I aint dead yet
I said, shoot me again, shoot me again, come on
Shoot me again, shoot me again, come on
Shoot me again, shoot me again, shoot me
Shoot me again, shoot me againAll the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you
All the shots, all the shots
All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at youI bite my tongue, tryin not to shoot back
No compromise, my heart won't pump the other wayWake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleep
Wake the sleeping giant, wake the beast
Wake the sleeping dog, no, let him sleepI bite my tongue, tryin not to shoot back
All the shots I take
I spit back at you
All the shit you fake
Comes back to haunt you
All the shots, all the shots
All the shots I take
What difference did I make?
All the shots I take
I spit back at you
