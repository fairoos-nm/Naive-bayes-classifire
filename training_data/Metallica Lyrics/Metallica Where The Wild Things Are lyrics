 So wake up sleepy one
It's time to save your worldSteal dreams and give to you
Shoplift a thought or two
All children touch the sun
Burn fingers one by one, by one...Will this earth be good to you
Keep you clean or stain through...So wake up sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are
Yeah, toy soldiers off to war...Big eyes to open soon
Believing all under sun and moon
But does heaven knows you're here
And did they give you smiles or tears
No, no tearsWill this earth be good to you
Keep you clean or stain through...So wake up sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are... yeah, yeah
Toy soldiers off to war...You swing your ass all down (Hand puppets storm the base! Flags up now cannons rage!
Hand puppets storm the base!)
Call to arms the trumpets sound (Flags up now cannons rage! All clowns head for the
rear! Slingshots fire to the air!)Toy horses start the charge (All clowns head for the rear! Slingshots fire to theair! Slip into the edge of death!)
Robots, chessmen standing guard (Crossfire to the marionettes! Slip into the edge
of death! Crossfire to the marionettes!)
We shall never surrender
All the children touch the sun
Burn your fingers one by one
Will this earth be good to you
Keep you clean or stain through...
So wake up sleepy one
It's time to save your world
You're where the wild things are, oh-yeah
Toy soldiers off to war...
So close your little eyes...
