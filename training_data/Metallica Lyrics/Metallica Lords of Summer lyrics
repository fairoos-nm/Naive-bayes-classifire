 Sight
Pale riders into the night
Galloping harder and fasterThrough your dreaming wake
Walk through the fire innate
Frost bitten soul below zeroExcitation
Are you remembering the sound
Recall the shaking of the groundCalling, calling
All as one
Lords of summer bring the sunComing, coming
Winter's yearn
Lords of summer shall returnAt last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
For soon the lords of summer shall returnLords of summer shall returnStraight
Life passes through penetrate
It's been a long lonely winterIllumination
Bright
Fading the volume and light
Reanimated by fireTransformation
Become the nexus of the sound
Become the shaking of the groundCalling, calling
All as one
Lords of summer bring the sunComing, coming
Winter's yearn
Lords of summer have returnedAt last the thawing has begun
Come trade your darkness for the sun
Melting the chill of winter's turn
Now that the lords of summer have returnedLords of summer have returned
