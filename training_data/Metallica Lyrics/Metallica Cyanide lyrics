 Sleep and dream of this
Death angel's kiss
Brings final bliss
CompletelyEmpty they say
Death won't you let me stay
Empty they say
Death hear me call your name
Uhh call your nameSuicide I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermoreWait, wait patiently
Your death black wings
Unfolding sleep
Spreading on meEmpty they say
Death won't you let me stay
Empty they say
Death hear me call your name
Uhh call your nameSuicide I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermoreSay is that rain or are they tears
That stained your concrete face for years
The crying, weeping, shedding strife
Year after year, life after lifeIn narrow freshly broken ground
A concrete angel laid right down
Upon the grave which swallows fast
It's peace at last, oh peace at lastEmpty they say
Death won't you let me stay
Empty they say
Death hear me call your name
Call your name
Suicide I've already died
You're just the funeral I've been waiting for
Cyanide living dead inside
Break this empty shell forevermore
Forevermore
Forevermore
It's just the funeral I've been waiting for
