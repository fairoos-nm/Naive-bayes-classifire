 Story starts
Quiet town
Small town boy
Big time frownNever talks
Never plays
Different path
Lost his wayThe streets are red
Red I'm afraidThere's no confetti
No parade
Nothing happens in this boring place
But oh my god how it all did changeNow they all pray
Blood stain wash away
He said
Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
I heard himHe said
Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my wayAll things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today
I always said
Something wrong
With little strange
Ronnie LongNever laughed
Never smiled
Talked alone for miles and miles and miles
Gallow calls
Son I say
Keep your smile and laugh all day
Think once again in this boring place
For little boys how they soon change
Now they all pray
Blood stain wash away
He saidLost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
I heard himHe said
Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my wayAll things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today
(Spoken)
Yeah, well all the green things died
When Ronnie moved to this place
He saidDon't you dare ask
Why I'm cursed to wear this faceNow we all know why
The children called him Ronnie Frown
When he pulled that gun from his pocketThey all fall down, down, down
He said
Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
I heard him
He screamed
Lost my way
This bloody day
Lost my way
All things wash away
But blood stained the sun red today
That's right
All things wash away
They all fall down
But blood stained the sun today
All things wash away
And they all fall down
But blood stained the sun today
