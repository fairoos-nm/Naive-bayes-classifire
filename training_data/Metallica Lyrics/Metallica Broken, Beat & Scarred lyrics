 You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
You rise, you fall, you're down then you rise again
What don't kill you'll make you more strongRise, fall down, rise again
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
Rise, fall down, rise again
What don't kill you'll make you more strongThrough black days, through black nights
Through pitch black insightsBreaking your teeth on the hard life a-coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard!The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
The dawn, the death, the fight to the final breath
What don't kill you'll make you more strongDawn, death, fight, final breath
What don't kill you'll make you more strong
Dawn, death, fight, final breath
What don't kill you'll make you more strongThey scratch me, they scrape me
They cut and rape meBreaking your teeth on the hard life a-coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
But we die hard!Breaking your teeth on the hard life a-coming
Show your scars
Cutting your feet on the hard earth running
Show your scars
Braiding your soul in a hard luck story
Show your scars
Spilling your blood in a hot sun's foray
Show your scars
Breaking your life, broken, beat and scarred
We die hard!
We die hard!
We die hard!
