 Where do I take this pain of mine?
I run but it stays right by my sideSo tear me open, pour me out!
There's things inside that scream and shout
And the pain still hates me
So hold me until it sleeps
Just like the curse, just like the stray
You feel it once and now it stays
Now it staysSo tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me until I'm cleanIt grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you so hold me
Until it sleeps
So tell me why you've chosen me
Don't want your grip, don't want your greed
Don't want it
I'll tear me open, make you gone
No more can you hurt anyone
And the fear still shakes me
So hold me until it sleepsIt grips you so hold me
It stains you so hold me
It hates you so hold me
It holds you, holds you, holds you until it sleeps
I don't want itSo tear me open but beware
There's things inside without a care
And the dirt still stains me
So wash me
Till cleanI'll tear me open, make you gone
No longer will you hurt anyone
And the hate still shapes me
So hold me until it sleeps
Until it sleeps
