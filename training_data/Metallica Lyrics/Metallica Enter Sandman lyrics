 Say your prayers, little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyoneI tuck you in, warm within
Keep you free from sin
Till the sandman he comesSleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tightExit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never landSomething's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars
Dreams of dragon's fire
And of things that will bite, yeahSleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tightExit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never landYeah heah
Now I lay me down to sleep
(Now I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
(Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake
(If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take
(Pray the Lord my soul to take)Hush little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your headExit: light
Enter: night
Grain of sand
Exit: light
Enter: night
Take my hand
We're off to never never landYeah ahaaha
Boo
Yeah yeah
Yo oh
We're off to never never land
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
Take my hand
We're off to never never land
