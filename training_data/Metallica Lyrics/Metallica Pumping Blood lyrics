 If I pump out blood in the sunshine
Oil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted awayA nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that Im pumping awayLike bees over the air
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that Im pumping awayOff the pump
Off the thing
The blood that Im pumping awayIf I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas
And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heartAs I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skinWill you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heartIf Im pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of meAnd my coagulating heartWaggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping bloodWould you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, mercy
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut meUse a knife on meBe shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of loveSupreme violation
Supreme violation
Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech youOh Jack I beseech you
Supreme violationBlood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayedI will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored mans dickBlood spurting from me
Oh Jack, Jack I beseech
Jack, I beseech you, I beseech
In the end it was an ordinary heartOh Jack I beseech you
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heartIn the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heartJack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you
Supreme violation . . . OhJack, Jack, Jack I beseech you
I call out your nameBlood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen
And knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored mans dick
Blood spurting from me
Blood spurting from me
