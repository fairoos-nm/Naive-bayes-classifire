 My life suffocates
Planting seeds of hate
I've loved, turned to hate
Trapped far beyond my fateI give, you take
This life that I forsake
Been cheated of my youth
You turned this lie to truth
Anger, misery
You'll suffer unto meHarvester of sorrow
Language of the madHarvester of sorrow
Pure black looking clear
My work is done soon here
Try getting back to meGet back which used to be
Drink up, shoot in
Let the beatings begin
Distributor of painYour loss becomes my gain
Anger, miseryYou'll suffer unto me
Harvester of sorrowLanguage of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
All have said their prayers
Invade their nightmaresTo see into my eyes
You'll find where murder lies
Infanticide
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Language of the mad
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
Harvester of sorrow
