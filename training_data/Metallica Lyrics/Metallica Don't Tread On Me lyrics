 Don't tread on me
So don't tread on meLiberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling of her tail
Never begins it, never, but once engaged...
Never surrenders, showing the fangs of rageSo don't tread on meSo be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...Don't tread on meLove it or leave it, she with the deadly bite
Quick is the blue tongue, forked as a lightning strike
Shining with brightness, always on surveillance
The eyes, they never close, emblem of vigilanceWoo, no, no, no...So don't tread on meSo be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...Don't tread on meSo be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
Liberty or death, what we so proudly hail
Once you provoke her, rattling on her tail
So be it
Threaten no more
To secure peace is to prepare for war
So be it
Settle the score
Touch me again for the words that you will hear evermore...
Don't tread on me
