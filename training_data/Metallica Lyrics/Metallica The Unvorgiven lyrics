 New blood joins this earthAnd quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rulesWith time the child draws inThis whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this dayHis will they'll take away
What I've felt
What I've knownNever shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have beenWhat I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub the unforgivenThey dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them allThis bitter man he isThroughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot winA tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfullyThat old man here is me
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shownNever be
Never seeWon't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've knownNever shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub the unforgiven
Solo
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub the unforgiven
Never free
Never me
So I dub the unforgiven
You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub the unforgiven
Never free
Never me
So I dub the unforgiven
You labeled me
I'll label you
So I dub the unforgiven
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven...
