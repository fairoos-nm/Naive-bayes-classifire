 Sound is ripping through your ears
The deafening sound of metal nears
Your bodies waiting for his whips
The taste of leather on your lipsHear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom LordVictims falling under chains
You hear them crying death pains
The fists of terrors breaking through
Now there's nothing you can doHear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord(Solo)
(Bridge)
(Solo)
The leather armies have prevailedThe Phantom Lord has never failed
Smoke is lifting from the ground
The rising volume metal sound
Hear the cry of War
Louder than before
With his sword in hand
to control the land
Crushing metal strikes
on this frightening night
Fall onto your knees
For the Phantom Lord
Fall to your knees
and bow to the Phantom Lord
