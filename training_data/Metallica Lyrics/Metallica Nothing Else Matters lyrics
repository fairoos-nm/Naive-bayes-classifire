 So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trust in who we are
And nothing else mattersNever opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else mattersTrust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else mattersNever cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I knowSo close, no matter how far

All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in youEvery day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do

Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trust in who we are
