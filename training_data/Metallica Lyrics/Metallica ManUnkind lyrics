 Chaos
Awaiting for Adam's return
Madness
Smiling, as we watch it burnI've becomeHostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kindGarden
Of Eden, so simple and pure
Greedy
Needy, must we have more?I've become
Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kindFascinate
Partner of insanity
Decimate
Lessons we never learnDominate
Killing of the innocence
Deviate
And to dust you return
YeahSeized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Seized by the day
All the dark days of your lifeSeized by the day
Frozen captive by the night
Led so astray
All the dark days of your lifeZero
Reset, creation of man
Foolish
Ready, to witness again?I've become
Hostage to my mind
Left myself behind
Blind lead blind
Quest to find
Faith in man(un)kindFaith in man(un)kind
Oh, Faith in man(un)kind
Faith in man(un)kind
Oh, Faith in man(un)kind
