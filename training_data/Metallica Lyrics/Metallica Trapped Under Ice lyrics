 I don't know how to live through this hell
Woken up, I'm still locked in this shell
Frozen soul, frozen down to the core
Break the ice, I can't take anymoreFreezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under iceCrystallized, as I lay here and rest
Eyes of glass stare directly at death
From deep sleep I have broken away
No one knows, no one hears what I sayFreezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice(Scream!) from my soul
(Fate!) mystified
(Hell!) forever more(Scream!) from my soul
(Fate!) mystified
(Hell!) forever moreNo release from my cryonic state
What is this? I've been stricken by fate
Wrapped up tight, cannot move, can't break free
Hand of doom has a tight grip on meFreezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under iceFreezing
Can't move at all
Screaming
Can't hear my call
I am dying to live
Cry out
I'm trapped under ice
