 Fortune, fame, mirror vain, gone insane
But the memory remains
Heavy rings on fingers wave
Another star denies the grave
See the nowhere crowd cry the nowhere tears of honor
Like twisted vines that grow
That hide and swallow mansions whole
And dim the light of an already faded prima donnaFortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
But the memory remains
Heavy rings hold cigarettes
Up to lips that time forgetsWhile the Hollywood sun sets behind your backAnd can't the band play on?
Just listen, they play my song
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insaneFortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
Dance little tin goddess(na-na-na-na...)
Drift away, fade away, little tin goddess
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to black
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
Fortune, fame; mirror vain; gone insane
But the memory remains
Ash to ash, dust to dust, fade to blackBut the memory remains
Yeah
Faded prima donna, yeah, yeah
Dance little tin goddess, dance
(na-na-na-na...)
