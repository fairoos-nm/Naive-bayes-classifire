 Hate is a train
That thunders aimless through my head
And hate is the fame
Chained to the wheel until I'm deadRage is a flame
Creates a touch to boil the seas
And rage is to blame
Forever sorry I shall beAnd from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revengeYou took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
Straight down into the sorrow but still I standWrath is the name
Branding suffer onto you
And wrath takes the shame
And holds me down until it's throughAnd from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revengeYou took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
I sink into the sorrow but still I standAnd hate is a train
A beast awakened by your call
And hate is a train
A beast that never slows at allAnd from a darkness I descend
Clenching a torch of sweet revenge
Burst into flame, the bitter end
And shake the gates of hell againI'm cursed to drown in sorrowYou took away tomorrow, still I stand
I ride into the sorrow, still I stand
You took away tomorrow, still I stand
You left me here with sorrow, still I stand
