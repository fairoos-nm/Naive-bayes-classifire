 Fell no pain, but my life ain't easy
i know i'm my best friend
no one cares, but i'm so much stronger
i'll fight until the end
to escape from the true false world
undamaged destiny
can't get caught in the endless circle
ring of stupidity
Out of my own, out to be free
one with my mind, they just can't see
no need to hear things that they say
life is for my own to live my own way
Rape my mind and destroy my feelings
don't tell my what to do
i don't care now, 'cause i'm on my side
and i can see through you
feed my brain with your so called standards
who says that i ain't right
break away from your common fashion
see through your blurry sight
Out of my own, out to be free
one with my mind, they just can't see
no need to hear things that they say
life is for my own to live my own way
See they try to bring the hammer down
no damn chains can hold me to the ground
life is for my own to live my own way
