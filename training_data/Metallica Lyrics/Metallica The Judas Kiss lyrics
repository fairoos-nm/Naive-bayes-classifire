 When the world has turned its back
When the days have turned pitch black
When the fear abducts your tongue
When the fire's dead and goneSo what now?
Where go I?When you think it's all said and doneWhen you are the ostracized
Selfish written, dead goodbyes
Twisting of the tourniquet
When the pieces never fitSo what now?
Where go I?When you think it's all said and doneBow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kissWhen the storm has blacked your sky
Intuition crucify
When the ego strips your reign
Assassinate the living flameSo what now?
Where go I?When you think it's all said and doneVenom of a life insane
Bites into your fragile vein
Internalize and decimate
Patronize and complicateSo what now?
Where go I?When you think it's all said and doneBow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kissJudas lives recite this vow
I've become your new god nowFollowed you from dawn of time
Whisper thoughts into your mind
Watched your towers hit the ground
Lured the children never found
Helped your kings abuse their crown
In the heart of feeble man
Plant the seeds of my own plan
The strong and powerful will fall
Find a piece of me in all
Inside you all
So bow down
Sell your soul to me
I will set you free
Pacify your demons
Bow down
Surrender unto me
Submit infectiously
Sanctify your demons
Into abyss
You don't exist
Cannot resist
The Judas kiss
