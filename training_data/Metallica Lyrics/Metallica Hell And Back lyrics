 There is nowhere else I can run to
She is wretched but she comforts me
After everyone goes home
She's always there for meAnd when the sun goes hellbound
And the moon does resurrect the night
I'll hide within her
Not much good has come out of the lightAfter everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and backStraight to Hell and backWhen they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and backStraight to Hell and back
Straight down yeahA lonely light in a window
Just longing for some company
Tragic, heartless and hateful
But there's nothing as willing as sheAnd when the night has fallen
It falls hard and then it all begins
When she starts her calling
I feel my darkness growing from withinAfter everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and backStraight to Hell and backWhen they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and backStraight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
I will run straight to Hell and backI become two
We become one
Unbridled... unequaled... unholy... undoneThe path is cut deep
The path is worn well
I'll follow my footsteps to the warmth of HellThe warmth of Hell
After everyone goes home
And I'm left here on my own
I will run straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
When they turn out all their lights
And I'm left to brood at night
Always return to Hell and back
Return to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
Straight to Hell and back
I will run straight to Hell and back
Straight down
