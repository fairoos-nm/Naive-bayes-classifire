 As I was goin' over
The Cook and Kerry mountains
I saw the Captain Farrell
His money he was countin'
I first produced my pistol
And then produced my rapier
I said, "stand and deliver"
Or the devil he may take yaI took all of his money
And it was a pretty penny
I took all of his money
And I brought it home to Molly
She swore that she'd love me
No never would she leave me
But devil take that woman!
Yeah!
For you know, she tricked me easyMush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-oBeing drunk and weary
I went to Molly's chamber
Taking Molly with me
But I never knew the danger
For about six or maybe seven
Yeah, I watched Captain Farrell
I jumped up, with my pistols
And I shot him with both barrellsMush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-oYeah, yeah, whiskey!
Yeah, ohNow some men like the fishing
And some men like the fowling
And some men like the hear
The hear cannon ball a roaring
Me, I like sleeping
Specially in my Molly's chamber
But here I am in prison
Here I am with a ball and chain, yeahMush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Whack for my daddy-o
Whack for my daddy-o
There's whiskey in the jar-o
Yeah!
Whiskey in the jar-oMush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
Mush a ring, dum-a-do dum-a-da
