 Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honestyInbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the endBlood will follow blood
Dying time is hereDamage incorporatedSlamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out? You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life ain't for you and we? re the cureHonesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it but it' s no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fallBlood will follow blood
Dying time is hereDamage incorporatedWe chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee with fear you run
You'll know just where we come fromDamage incorporatedGoDamage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy endings on these dark sets
All' s fair for damage Inc. you see
Step a little closer if you please
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
