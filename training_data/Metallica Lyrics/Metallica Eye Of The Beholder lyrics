 Do you see what I see?
Truth is an offense
You silence for your confidence
Do you hear what I hear?
Doors are slamming shut
Limit your imagination
Keep you where they must
Do you feel what I feel?
Bittering distress
Who decides what you express?
Do you take what I take?
Endurance is the wordMoving back instead of forward
Seems to me absurd
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you readYou can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friendFreedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
Do you fear what I fear?
Living properly
Truths to you are lies to me
Do you choose what I choose?
More alternatives
Energy derives from both the plus and negative
Do you need what I need?
Boundaries overthrown
Look inside
To each his ownDo you trust what I trust?
Me, myself and I
Penetrate the smoke screen
I see through the selfish lieDoesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I sayIndependence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom with their exception
(Bridge and solo)
Do you know what I know?Your money and your wealth
You silence just to hear yourself
Do you want what I want?
Desire not a thingI hunger after independence
Lengthen freedom's ring
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you readYou can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
Independence limited
Freedom of choice is made for you, my friend
Freedom of speech is words that they will bend
Freedom no longer frees you
Doesn't matter what you see
Or into it what you read
You can do it your own way
If it's done just how I say
