 The window burns to light the way back homeA light that warms, no matter where they've goneThey're off to find the hero of the dayBut what if they should fall by someone's wicked way?Still the window burns, time so slowly turnsSomeone there is sighingKeepers of the flames
Do you feel your names?Can't you hear your babies crying?(Mama, they try and break me)(Still they try and break me)'scuse me while I tend to how I feelThese things return to me that still seem realNow deservingly this easy chairBut the rocking stops by wheels of despairDon't want your aid
But the fist I've made for years won't hold or feelNo I'm not all me
So please excuse me while I tend to how I feelBut now the dreams and waking screams that ever last through the night
So build the wall behind it crawl and hide until it's lightSo can't you hear your babies crying now?Still the window burns
Time so slowly turns
And someone there is sighing
Keepers of the flames, can't you hear your names?
Can't you hear your babies crying?
But now the dreams and waking screams that
ever last the night
So build a wall behind it crawl
And hide until it's light
So can't you hear your babies crying now?
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, they try
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try and break me
Mama, they try, mama, the try
