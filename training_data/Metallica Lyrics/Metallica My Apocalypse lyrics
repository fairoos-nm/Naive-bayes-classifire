 Claustrophobic
Crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in pull that pin
Fear thy name: Extermination
Desecrate inhale the fireSo we cross that line
Into the Crypt
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypseDeadly vision
Prophecy reveal
Death magnetic
Pulling closer still
Fear thy name: Annihilation
Desolate inhale the fireSo we cross that line
Into the Crypt
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypseMy ApocalypseCrushing metal, ripping skin
Tossing body, mannequin
Spilling blood, bleeding gasMangled flesh, snapping spines
Dripping bloody valentine
shatter face, spitting glassSplit apart
Split apart
Split apart
Spit
Spit it outWhat makes me drift a little bit closer
Dead man takes the steering wheel
What makes me know it's time to cross over
Want to repeat until i feelSee through the skin the bones they all rattle
Future and past they disagree
Flesh falls away the bones they all shatter
I start to see the end in me
See the end in meClaustrophobic
crawl out of this skin
Heart explosive
Reach in pull that pinViolate annihilate
My Wounds unto my eyes
Obliterate exterminate
And life itself denied
Fear thy name as hell awakens
Destiny inhale the fire
So we've crossed that line
Into the Crypt
Total eclipse
Suffer unto my apocalypse
Tyrant awaken my apocalypse
Demon awaken my apocalypse
Heaven awaken my apocalypse
Suffer forever my apocalypse
