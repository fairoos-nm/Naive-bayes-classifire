 I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops meNow that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there is not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain nowHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake meBack in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll liveFed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from meHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake meNow the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh God help meHold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help meDarkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell
