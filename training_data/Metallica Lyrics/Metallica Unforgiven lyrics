 New blood joins this earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pain disgrace
The young boy learns their rulesWith time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and onHe's known
Oooh a vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take awayWhat I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have beenWhat I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgivenThey dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he isThroughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot winA tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is meWhat I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have beenWhat I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven(1st and 2nd solos)What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have beenWhat I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven(3rd solo)Never free
