 Blacked out
Pop queen, amphetamine
The screams crashed into silenceTapped out
Doused in the gasoline
The high times going timelessDecadence
Death of the innocence
The pathway starts to spiralInfamy
All for publicity
Destruction going viralLight it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, kill the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High againSold your soul
Built a higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown awaySame rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flameTwisted
Backstabbing wicked
The delusion absolutionPerjurer
Fame is the murderer
Seduce you into ruinLight it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, tell the truth
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High againSold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown awaySame rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flame
BurnGuarantee your name, you go and kill yourself
The vultures feast around you still
Overdose on shame and insecurity
If one won't do that fistful willDeath scene
Black hearse the limousine
A grave filled with seductionVaccine
Fame does the murdering
She builds up for destructionSo light it up
Ah, light it up
Another hit erases all the pain
Bulletproof
Ah, no excuse
You're falling, but you think you're flying high
High againSold your soul
Built the higher wall
Yesterday
Now you're thrown awaySame rise and fall
Who cares at all?
Seduced by fame
A moth into the flameAddicted to the
