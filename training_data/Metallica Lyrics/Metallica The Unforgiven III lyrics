 How could he know this new dawn's light, would change his life forever?
Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, by the light of golden treasure
Was he the one, causing pain, With his careless dreaming?
Been afraid, always afraid, Of the things he's feeling
He
could
just
be
gone
He
would justsail on
He'll just sail on
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive.
And how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?
These days drift on inside a fog, It's thick and suffocatingHis seeking life outside its hell, Inside intoxicatingHe's run aground
Like his life
Water much too shallow
Slipping fast
Down with his ship
Fading in the shadows
Now
...a...
castaway
They've
all goneaway
They've gone awayHow can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
And how can I blame you?, When it's me I can't forgive?
Forgive meForgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me notForgive me
Forgive me not
Forgive me
Forgive me, why can't I forgive me?Set sail to sea, but pulled off course, By the light of golden treasure
How could he know this new dawn's light, Would change his life forever?
How can I be lost, If I've got nowhere to go?
Search for seas of gold, How come it's got so cold?
How can I be lost, In remembrance I relive
So how can I blame you, When it's me I can't forgive?
