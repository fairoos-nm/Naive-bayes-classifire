 One crown
Shines on through the sound
One crown
Born to lose
One man
Does not give a damn
One man
No excuseAces wild
Aces high
All the aces
Aces 'til you dieWhite lines fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and onHear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to winOne fist
Hammers through the mist
One fist
Steady on
One heart
Diehard from the start
One heart
Beats its songMurder all
Murder one
Give me murder
Second class to noneHeadlights fading
The iron horse rolls on and on and onHear your thunder
Still feeding back
Still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
Living to winHear your thunder
Still feeding back
I still hear your thunder
The man in black
Born to lose
No excuse'Til the end
Been living to win
Been living to win
