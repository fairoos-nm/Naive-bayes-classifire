 Oh poor twisted me
Oh poor twisted me
I feast on sympathy
I chew on suffer
I chew on agonyAnd swallow whole the pain
Oh it's too good to be
All this misery
Is just for oh poor twisted me
Poor twisted meOoh yeah
Poor twisted mePoor mistreated me
Poor mistreated me
I drown without a sea
I'm filled with sorrow
Once filled with miseryAnd hated the deep dark blue
Oh woe is me
Such a burden to bear
Poor mistreated me, yeahFinally reached the shore
I survived the storm
Now your feeling cold ever since he was born
Your pain is so over youFinally reached the shore
I survived the storm
Now your feeling cold ever since he was born
No moreYour pain is so over you
Could ya be my friend?
Such a burden to see
Oh poor twisted meYou, you, poor twisted me
