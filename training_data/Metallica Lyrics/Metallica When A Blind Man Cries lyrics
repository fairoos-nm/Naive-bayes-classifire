 If you're leaving, close the door
I'm not expecting people, anymore
Hear me grieving, lying on the floor
Whether drunk or dead, I really ain't too sureI'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder taleHad a friend once, in a room
Had a good time, but it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
We found a reason, for the things we had to doI'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
Now my room is cold
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
He feels it from his soulI'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder tale
