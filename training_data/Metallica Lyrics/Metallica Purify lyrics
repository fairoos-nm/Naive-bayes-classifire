 Tear it down
Strip the layers off
My turpentine
Old paint, old looks
Cover up the past
White heat, white light
Super white bones
Bones of you and IPurify, can't you help me?
Purify, won't you help me?

Purify, won't you help me?
You and I purify
You and I purify
PurifyTruth and dare
Peeling back the skin
Acid wash, ghost white
Ultra clean
Wanna be skeleton
Clear eyes, diamond eyes
